As of DSE:02-01-20I populate a property called RuleReturnValue with the return result of the rule. I have also added it to the GUI display. This will only be tracked if the other rule level tracking is enabled (i.e. .DSEExecuteRulesLogging.TrackRulesRun is set to "true").

In the case of iterative rules, only the last executed value is recorded and displayed.

FieldValue "pyCaption": When initial login screen is present to change the text of the taskbar title you can simply override the"Welcome to PegaRULES" field value and give it a different localized value.



FrameSetDevelopercontains thetitle "PegaRULES Process Commander" which gets displayed for the taskbar title when logged in to PRPC. This rule is final so how do we change this text? I don't believe there is a solution currently for this other than asking for an enhancement from Pega to utilize a caption much like above.

Due to the lack of time by the owner of the story, only 5 unit tests will be converted to the new application/environment. If more time is available, more tests will be converted. If not, then an additional story will need to be written to cover converting the remaining unit tests.

2014-12-20 16:42:57.0940 Content is Encryption Requirements 

Please do a search for encryption in the Information Security Policy and Standards document. Highlights of the sections include:
E) Handling Requirements
1)
GMAC Secretinformation must beencryptedin storage and transmission, bothinternally within the GMAC network, as well as externally
2)
GMAC Confidentialdata must be encrypted in storage and transmissionexternally. Encryption is discretionary within GMAC internally (depends on
sensitivity)
3) The following types of
Personal Informationmust be encrypted in transmissionand storage. First name or initial and last name in combination with one of the
following:
a) A social security number or other government-issued identifier such as a
tax identification number or drivers license number
b) Financial account information (account number, credit or debit card

GMAC Information Security Policy & Standards
 2007 GMAC, LLC.
Corporate Policy ManualPublished: 22-May-2007All rights reserved. Page 38 of 66
Printed copies of this document are considered uncontrolled and unofficial
Encryption of these types of Personal Information is not required if transmitted on
the internal Local Area Network (LAN) within a GMAC
Enterprise-Class DataCenter
or stored on servers within the highest Tier of GMAC enterprise-class datacenters as defined in the GMAC security baseline on Data Centers. In addition,
the enterprise-class data centers need to have compensating controls in place to
limit access to data files containing Personal Information. Encryption is required for
transmitting these types of Personal Information across a network that is external
to the GMAC enterprise-class data center.
4) In handling GMAC Information pertaining to GMAC personnel matters, GMAC
managers must adhere to any additional controls that have been established to
comply with local laws protecting employees. These directives are outlined in
policies managed by GMAC Human Resources.
5) The processing and handling of Personal Information and Sensitive Data may be
governed by general or specific data privacy statements or laws. To determine
whether particular information constitutes Personal Information or Sensitive Data in
any jurisdiction, and applicable restrictions on processing and handling of such
information, including restrictions on the transmission across national borders
contact the Global Privacy Center at GMAC Headquarters or the Legal Staff. For
more information, visit the GMAC Global Privacy Home Page.
6) For
Export-Controlledinformation, although export control laws vary by country,they generally restrict the export of technical data and technology related to
military/defense articles and information that has both commercial and military
uses (referred to as dual-use).
7) The Export-Controlled designation does not include information that has an
export classification of EAR99. However, if the proposed export of EAR99
information is to an embargoed country, to an end-user of concern or in support of
a prohibited end-use, you may be required to obtain an export authorization before
proceeding with the export. Information deemed to be "Export-Controlled" cannot
be exported or shared without the proper export authorization.
Decisions to use GMAC SECRET and GMAC CONFIDENTIAL categories and associated
controls to protect GMAC Information other than Personal Information or Export Controlled,
which could result in adverse consequences such as the above, are at the discretion of the
GMAC Business Unit based on the severity of the impact of unauthorized disclosure.

Also attached these to the story in a spreadsheet.
QuestionsAnswersCARS has been updated will be known by which property in Pega. Has thisbeen built as a part of GIF- CARS interface, if so to which property mapsDont know of any property but question should be raised to the GIF team to check their data dictionary.I did find a response property that looks promising but I don't have a definition for it.(GMAC-SAM-Integration-GIFSoap-AI2-RESPONSE_DATA.LAST_REVISION_DATE property)At what time intervals should we allow a call to be made to CARSAs needed when an SR or Account is opened.How frequently do we think that the same SR will be opened in the lifecycle of a SR?Probably <10 times for these SR types but this seems to be a capacity/performance related question.Let's leave performance until we discover an issue in performance testing.What points in the system does a SR get opened? Interaction history, SR open from worklist, find work,Open SR from a worklist, Open an SR from Interaction History, Open an Account from Account Search,If someone changes the data in CARS, when does that get reflected, is it real time or a nightly batch.Realtime at the time of SR being opened or upon click of the Refresh button.If it is not real time,can we just provide a manual refresh CARS buttonnot applicable due to realtime requirement

Answers also posted as an attachment to the story.
QuestionsAnswers1. Input criteria will be read only on the second page or do they want to modify the input date range on the fly (On the second page where reports are rendered)Whatever is easiest to provide quickly.We will demo the report to the business and ask them if what is provided is acceptable and if not we will modify as needed.2. Sum by year will represent only $ amount because date, a/c , charge off type,etc does not seem relevant when you are grouping by year, quarter month, week and even day.In addition to $ they would like "Count" of SRs in the grouping3. Do we want a drill down? If yes, do we want the drill down segregated by quarter, month, week, day or all at onceWe want drill down by summary level selected.So if they select Month then only summary bars for Apr, May, Jun, Jul, etc.If they select Day then summary bars for 04/01/08, 04/02/08, 04/03/08, etc.2008 + 2ndQuarter + Apr +1stweek + Monday - SC 001 -SC 002Or2008-SC001-SC0024. If my dates range (input parameter) is 04/01/08- 09/09/09. Is sum by year 04/01/08- 12/31/08 or 1/1/08-12/31/08 or 04/01/08- 04-03-09? Same question for month, week, quarter, etc?I believe in this scenario, Sum by year is 04/01/08-12/31/08 in one summary and 1/1/09-09/09/09 in the second summary.5. We will need to check the performance requirements based on the data that is stored/available in the database.Performance should be checked by the Performance Tester outside of the story.Do not worry about performance at this time.6. Should you be able to open a SR in read only mode after drill down? Or is It only for information and one will not be able to open the SR.For now, lets do whatever comes out of the box and/or is easist.Most important to provide a

2014-12-20 16:43:00.1350 Content is Additional questions from Offshore- 22-Jan-09 

1)Is the validation forsum by years/ Sum by quarteris needed if the date range selected is less than a year / quarter?
2) What does Chareoffcompletiondate map to,in COD? There are 3 types of date in the COD system:
a) Date of loss
b) Charge off Effective date
c) Charge off approve date
Similarly, there are two amounts, collectible and uncollectible amount. Which one maps to Charge off amount?
3) If the user selects "Sum by month" and clicks on the "+" sign that indicates drill down, does he then see "Sum by week"? or do they see all the SRs with the required details that were charged off in that month?
4) In question no.6 in the notes entered , there is an incomplete answer/statement. Can you please update that?
Also for the same question no.6, as i understand correctly, Wipro will need to get back and communicate whether a SR can be opened or not, correct?

What field should be mapped to Charge Off Amount? I talked to the business about this and they said for this report there should be 3 Charge off Amount columns on the report. They are:1.) Uncollectible Amount 2.) Collectible Amount3.) Uncollectible/Collectible Total Amount

Per the call this morning 1/23/2009, proceed with using the Summary View instead of using the List View. This should enable Summing and Group By.
Also, proceed to use the Single button on a Summary List to popup a set of buttons to support Email, Print, Export features.

1. The rest of that answer was: Most important to provide a working demo of the report without the ability to drill down into the SR.

2. In the end, we will need the ability to open from the SR line of the report through some mechanism. Options for the mechanism is what needs to be determined by the technical team.
Examples of options may be:
Double click on the SR,
Single click on the SR and get a popup window allowing the user to open the SR,
Single click on the SR and receive a Glimpse view that allows the user to open the SR.

3. No validation is needed. If they select a time period that is smaller than the summary period, the summary period should summarize appropriately using the data received from the date range. E.g. Jan 15, 2008 through Jan 15, 2009 with summary set to Year should have 2 summary lines. One for 2008 that contains Jan 15, 2008 through Dec 31, 2008. A second for 2009 that contains Jan 1, 2009 through Jan 15, 2009.

4. No, if they select Sum by Month, and they click the + sign to drill down, they then see the SRs for that month as a list. They do not see Weeks or Days summary levels.

2014-12-20 16:43:03.6780 Content is Date/Time Stamp Clarification 

Latest Date/Time Stamp will be displayed when we click the refresh button in the UI. This date will signify the time when was the last time data was fetched from CARS. This is just for display on UI screen.

Reply from Jeff::
I think that this sounds fine as long as the date/time is only updated after the refresh is complete. That way, if the refresh fails for some reason, we dont mislead the user by showing the date/time the button was clicked instead of the date/time of the update.

Do we append that information with some kind of a user friendly message? The SR was last refreshed with CARS at HH:MM. etc,etc.

Also, is there a specific position/location that the button has to be placed on? Bottom of the screen, under the home tab,etc.
These are minor aesthetic related questions.

Regarding the mapping of fields for the Systematic Letter Generation story, all of the fields you dont have mapped are currently not available from CARS or get set as a manual step in the R1 letter generation screen.In iteration 2 we will need to figure out how to systematically generate values for these fields based on logic we will get from the business and from looking at the R1 manual steps.

For now, just hard code values that name what should go in that field so that the letter reflects values to validate letter generation.

Pega's structure supports a certain model where an Operator belongs to one Unit and a Unit belongs to one Division and a Division belongs to one Organization. At the Division Level is where we call out Semperian versus Canada.
One option would be to create another Division that is Both Semp and Canada with it's own set of units.
Another option would be to have a these "Both" users have a U.S. and Canadian operator ID
A third option would be to hack something into Pega that is non standard to support the concept.

Hi,
We have an output attribute called "charge off category" which as we understand is determined by collectible and uncollectible amount? what will be the charge off category of a work item which has both collectible and uncollectible amount not equal to 0.
Regards,
Akshat
-------------------------------------------
Answer:
No, the charge off type does not depend on the collectible/uncollectible amount. The charge off type is selected, then the amounts are filled in.
If you are referring to the FDD, are you aware of the warranty work that has been done? Some of the charge off types have changed. Here is a list of what is in COD now:
Misuse
Misrepresentation
Total theft with insurance proceeds
Total collision with insurance proceeds
Total theft without insurance proceeds
Total collision without insurance proceeds
Skip

Abandonment

Approved BySame as Above

Preparers NameDo we you want to display name or Operator ID. If Do you want it to be
manually updated because there is no drop down option in the screen attached

Date ApprovedDo you want the date to be manually entered or the system should populate it?
If the system should populate then the Approver after entering all the details
saves the form ,closes it and then approves the work item. Then the date
should automatically gets populated in that field.When anyone opens the work

If my dates range (input parameter) is 04/01/08- 09/09/09. Is sum by year 04/01/08- 12/31/08 or 1/1/08-12/31/08 or 04/01/08- 04-03-09? Same question for month, week, quarter, etc?I believe in this scenario, Sum by year is 04/01/08-12/31/08 in one summary and 1/1/09-09/09/09 in the second summary.5.

2) What does Chareoffcompletiondate map to,in COD? There are 3 types of date in the COD system:
a) Date of loss
b) Charge off Effective date
c) Charge off approve date
Similarly, there are two amounts, collectible and uncollectible amount. Which one maps to Charge off amount?
3) If the user selects "Sum by month" and clicks on the "+" sign that indicates drill down, does he then see "Sum by week"? or do they see all the SRs with the required details that were charged off in that month?
4) In question no.6 in the notes entered , there is an incomplete answer/statement. Can you please update that?
Also for the same question no.6, as i understand correctly, Wipro will need to get back and communicate whether a SR can be opened or not, correct?

1. The rest of that answer was: Most important to provide a working demo of the report without the ability to drill down into the SR.

2. In the end, we will need the ability to open from the SR line of the report through some mechanism. Options for the mechanism is what needs to be determined by the technical team.
Examples of options may be:
Double click on the SR,
Single click on the SR and get a popup window allowing the user to open the SR,
Single click on the SR and receive a Glimpse view that allows the user to open the SR.

3. No validation is needed. If they select a time period that is smaller than the summary period, the summary period should summarize appropriately using the data received from the date range. E.g. Jan 15, 2008 through Jan 15, 2009 with summary set to Year should have 2 summary lines. One for 2008 that contains Jan 15, 2008 through Dec 31, 2008. A second for 2009 that contains Jan 1, 2009 through Jan 15, 2009.

4. No, if they select Sum by Month, and they click the + sign to drill down, they then see the SRs for that month as a list. They do not see Weeks or Days summary levels.

1)Is the validation forsum by years/ Sum by quarteris needed if the date range selected is less than a year / quarter?
2) What does Chareoffcompletiondate map to,in COD? There are 3 types of date in the COD system:
a) Date of loss
b) Charge off Effective date
c) Charge off approve date
Similarly, there are two amounts, collectible and uncollectible amount. Which one maps to Charge off amount?
3) If the user selects "Sum by month" and clicks on the "+" sign that indicates drill down, does he then see "Sum by week"? or do they see all the SRs with the required details that were charged off in that month?
4) In question no.6 in the notes entered , there is an incomplete answer/statement. Can you please update that?
Also for the same question no.6, as i understand correctly, Wipro will need to get back and communicate whether a SR can be opened or not, correct?

1. The rest of that answer was: Most important to provide a working demo of the report without the ability to drill down into the SR.

2. In the end, we will need the ability to open from the SR line of the report through some mechanism. Options for the mechanism is what needs to be determined by the technical team.
Examples of options may be:
Double click on the SR,
Single click on the SR and get a popup window allowing the user to open the SR,
Single click on the SR and receive a Glimpse view that allows the user to open the SR.

3. No validation is needed. If they select a time period that is smaller than the summary period, the summary period should summarize appropriately using the data received from the date range. E.g. Jan 15, 2008 through Jan 15, 2009 with summary set to Year should have 2 summary lines. One for 2008 that contains Jan 15, 2008 through Dec 31, 2008. A second for 2009 that contains Jan 1, 2009 through Jan 15, 2009.

4. No, if they select Sum by Month, and they click the + sign to drill down, they then see the SRs for that month as a list. They do not see Weeks or Days summary levels.

As we agreed that we will be following approach-2, below I'm putting the answers to the questions raised by offshore team. Please validate and confirm !!
Question
#1: According to approach 2 doc there is no field mentioned to give us the info of Preparer name and Phone no.

#3: Supervisor Name field is not there in Sample screen provided in version 1 but it is mentioned in Brads document.
Answer

2014-12-20 16:44:02.2190 Content is Some clarifications on Approach2 for the "Source document" story 

Hey Jeff,
With our knowledge of the approach 2 being used for the "source document" we studied the existing COD system in detail. There were some points where we realised that we would need inputs from you. Can you please help us answer them?
a) Is this uncollectible "source doc story"applicable for HRC too?There isno approval step for HRC. Do weneed to override the current function when uncollectible amt is present?b) On submit, should a work item go to the respective manager or will it go to the work basket(WB) for review? Currently, it goes to the WB for review do we need to explicitly ensure that the work item is routed to the supervisor/managerc) Behavior on Reject- what details will be displayed? Do we need to direct the work item to work basket? For follow up, we understand that the user has an option to route it back to the initiator or anyone other reportee in this org structure(existing in R1)d) we understand from the COD flow that we have a supervisor and a manager, we should route it to manager, can you pls confirm? The approach document says supervisor at one step and manager at other.e) Are the LOV given in the spread sheet final,we will be hardcoding them in the system,correct? Do we want a default value selected?

Hi Jeff/Duane/Brad,

Please clarify for the following

Assumptions::

We are not doing skill based rebalancing
We are not deleting the operators. We are just making them available/unavailable
When we are going to availability/unavailability of the agents the preamble is that they are already present in the site

Issues to be Addressed
What are we going to do with those work items with statuses fulfilled, resolved, cancelled or open phone calls? But as per our discussion Duane/Brad suggested that they are going to stay in the worklist only. But still it has to be confirmed by the business
the story also should be changed to remove the condition of adding /deleting. It should be only making available/Unavailable
All the workitems for all operators (belonging to a work group) have to be transferred to the workbasket.
Rebalancing on available/unavailable operators is based on user input. He can select one or more or all to do the rebalancing. Duane/Brad/Jeff to confirm.

In VersionOne Rebalance story should be split in to two parts and the changes needs to be incorporated as discussed in the call.

Please clarify for the following

Assumptions::

We are not doing skill based rebalancing
[BET - We will be doing skills based rebalancing. For the first showing of this functionality, we will only focus on a work group. But to complete the story, we will have to implement rebalance based on a skill (or set of skills)]
We are not deleting the operators. We are just making them available/unavailable [BET - correct].

All the workitems for all operators (belonging to a work group) have to be transferred to the workbasket. [BET - Yes, for allitems selected in arebalance step, they willbe transferred to the workgroup's workbasket such that theworkbasket routing process can redistribute the work].
Rebalancing on available/unavailable operators is based on user input. He can select one or more or all to do the rebalancing. Duane/Brad/Jeff to confirm. [BET - Yes, rebalancing is based on which workgroup gets selected to provide a list of operators. A select all button provides the quick selection of all operators to rebalance on. Otherwise, the user can select each operator one by one to include them in the rebalance.]

In VersionOne Rebalance story should be split in to two parts and the changes needs to be incorporated as discussed in the call. [BET - I added a new story to accomodate this. we will need to move those tasks/test that pertain to the availability process.]

BET - Responded to all questions except for[***TBD***]. This needs further input from the business/Jeff.
Please clarify for the following

Assumptions::

We are not doing skill based rebalancing
[BET - We will be doing skills based rebalancing. For the first showing of this functionality, we will only focus on a work group. But to complete the story, we will have to implement rebalance based on a skill (or set of skills)]
We are not deleting the operators. We are just making them available/unavailable [BET - correct].
When we are going to availability/unavailability of the agents the preamble is that they are already present in the site [BET - yes, the operators records will already exist in the system]

Issues to be Addressed
What are we going to do with those work items with statuses fulfilled, resolved, cancelled or open phone calls? But as per our discussion Duane/Brad suggested that they are going to stay in the worklist only. But still it has to be confirmed by the business [***TBD***]
the story also should be changed to remove the condition of adding /deleting. It should be only making available/Unavailable [BET - I will make this correction in the story]
All the workitems for all operators (belonging to a work group) have to be transferred to the workbasket. [BET - Yes, for allitems selected in arebalance step, they willbe transferred to the workgroup's workbasket such that theworkbasket routing process can redistribute the work].
Rebalancing on available/unavailable operators is based on user input. He can select one or more or all to do the rebalancing. Duane/Brad/Jeff to confirm. [BET - Yes, rebalancing is based on which workgroup gets selected to provide a list of operators. A select all button provides the quick selection of all operators to rebalance on. Otherwise, the user can select each operator one by one to include them in the rebalance.]

In VersionOne Rebalance story should be split in to two parts and the changes needs to be incorporated as discussed in the call. [BET - I added a new story to accomodate this. we will need to move those tasks/test that pertain to the availability process.]

Note with a decision received from ITG about the status of the source documentand rebalance story
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We spent time this afternoon reworking the Rebalance and Uncollectible stories into smaller stories that should be easier to understand and follow. We have not finished this process yet. Jeff Dahlberg will continue this process tomorrow and hopefully have it finished by end of day tomorrow. In the meantime, the dev team will need to focus their time on whatever existing tasks they can continue to make progress on. The requirements for these two stories have not changed. We are just reworking the stories so they should be more easy to understand and follow

Would the business want to look at Canned report containing charge offs which were in the cancelled status? I am attaching a list of statuses that the CO work items can have.

Hi Brad/Jeff/Duane,
We are able to transfer the workitems to the intended workbasket i.e., US_SR_Routing. But from their the workitems are not getting distributed across the worklists.
Based on Bapi Reddy inputs there are some conditions and logic which the transferred work items are not satisfying and so the SLA doesn't execute and hence the work item is still in the work basket itself.
We have started analyzing the activity but if you can provide your expertise guidance, would be of great help.

2014-12-20 16:44:25.2080 Content is Adding notes/answers for questions asked on the Hybrid approach 

What extra fields do we need to addin the initiator screen? Do we assume that"reason of entry" is same as "comments" and we can entirely copy the "comments" sections in the "reason for entry field"There are no new fields required on the Initiator's screen. For now, we will assume that the "Reason for Charge Off" is placed in the Comments field.

b) We need to capture preparer's name in the back ground. If a manager delegate the Follow up work to someone other than the original initiator and if the SR then comes to the manager for review(after follow up has been completed), do we update the preparer's name? Where is this information displayed for Mel?
At this point, the only place that Mel can see who all has worked on this SR is on the History screen. From there he can see who initiated the SR, who else worked on it, and what happened. No need to update the preparer's name.

c) We understand that if uncollectible amount(for a total loss type) isnot equal to 0while initiating , then it will go for managerfor approval else it will go for review as in the existing flow. Please correct us if something has been captured incorrectly.
This is correct.

d) if the support doc check box is not ticked and instead of hiding the "Approve" option in the flow action , can we justthrow an error message when user clicks on "Approve".
We can pop up a message box that informs the user "This Charge Off cannot be approved until the Supporting Document has been approved."

e)There is a statement that says "Padma can reject the work at this point with going through any additional process to update the supporting document".- did it mean "without going through any additional.."
Yes, "without going through any additional.." is what it should have read.

f) If Padma has updated a source document and then she clicks on "Reject", do we need to store the word doc as an attachment with the workitem or do we delete that?
At the point of Rejection, everything that is in place needs to be captured. So if there is an attachment we need to preserve it with the Rejected work object.

g) What other fields does the manager needs to see (in his harness) apart from the amount(existing) and comments(exiting fields). Any fields from the source document needs to come on the manager's screen?
The manager also needs to see the Approve check box and the Reject check box so that he can Approve or Reject the supporting document. If the manager "Rejects" the Supporting Document, he cannot be allowed to Approve the Charge Off. We need to provide the same style of warning as question "d" above but with the text "A rejected Supporting Document cannot support the approval of this Charge Off. Either Approve the Supporting Document or send this Charge Off back for rework."

f)If Padma has updated a source document and then she clicks on "Reject", do we need to store the word doc as an attachment with the workitem or do we delete that?At the point of Rejection, everything that is in place needs to be captured. So if there is an attachment we need to preserve it with the Rejected work object.
AJ's comments:Wewent through the R 1 process and realised that there is no "Reject" option for Padma however she has the "Resolve option". So the question would be,if Padmacreates a source document(Source document-Knoxville1.doc) which is attached to the work item and then at the last moment she decides to send it for follow up to either the initiator or someone else in the same work group(existing in R1). Now let's say the initiator amends the work item details as requested and then sends it to the process charge off workbasket (after approve et al..). This time it was picked up by another processor, Padma2. The questions are:
1) Will the initiator who got the request for follow up see that document(Source document-Knoxville1.doc) , how , from where will he access it please?
Answer as on 13-Feb:The initiator will see that document generated by Padma's earlier action as a part of the existing "add or edit attachments" function if he has access to it based on his role (as provided according to R1)
2)will Padma 2 see this document(Source document-Knoxville1.doc)?
Answer on 13-feb-09: Padma2 can see the document generated by Padma1 and as a part of the existing "add or edit attachments" function if she has access to it based on his role (as provided according to R1). However Padma 2 can click on the "Update the source document" and edit the fields and generate a source document that will replace the old one
3)In the Hybrid approach,we have a point no 9)
"If she clicks cancel on this harness, nothing has changed on the SR.If she updates fields and clicks the Generate Supporting Document button, then the process from step 6 is followed with the addition of removing the old document prior to generating the new one."

4) Our question here would be by "adding new while removing the old one", did we mean update the existing source document? When she clicks on "Update source document", we can show the harness with the values populated previously and Padma can edit them and save the document once again. Will that work?

Answer on 13-Feb: We need to update the document with the newly edited/entered information by Padma. There will be only 1 document that Padma1/2/3(any charge off processor) will see. This will be the most updated document/values that were entered by the processor. When Padma clicks on "Update source document", the pega screen will have all the previously entered information in the respective fields. Padma can then edit the fields that she wants to and generate the source document.

5)What are the mandatory fields for the source document, do we need to do any UI level validation to ensure that some important field is not missed?

Answer on 13-Feb: Jeff D will confirm with the business and let us know the set of mandatory fields in the supporting document.<It would also help us to get the corresponding error messages that we need to display when the mandatory fields are not entered>

6) Will the following fields be systematically populated or entered by Padma:

Dealer ? - Entered by Padma
Date Entry processed? - Entered by Padma


7) In which format will the data elements of the source document should be presented on the word document that is generated?

Answer on 13-Feb: Thesame format as the source document sample attached in the story will be used while generating the source document.

Please help us in getting these answers. Please let us know if something is not so clear or if you need more inputs to answer the questions

2014-12-20 16:44:28.1280 Content is Clarifications as on 13-FEB 

Hi Duane/Jeff/Brad,
Please find below some clarifications required regarding the Rebalance Story. And also I updated the issues that are resolved.
Questions ::

1.Is the rebalance story applicable only to US or itis across US and Canada? As per our understanding we are doing it for US only. Am I right?
2.We are working on the putting a column of WorkitemCount.
3.On clicking the close button on the confirmation screen as of now we are navigating the Rebalance Portal. But you mentioned that it should go to the rebalance screen. Once the rebalance is done and the user clicks on the close button on the confirmation screen it will close the window. Do you want to navigate to rebalance screen on clicking the close button?
4.Do we need a finer grain level of control to say a skill level? We need to discuss on this.
5.When you do the change availability you have asked us to incorporate the Print Button. I believe that this will be part of the Report Generation which is addressed as a separate story. Do you want to incorporate the same here. Please suggest.
6.We are analyzing on the logic of R1 and Agent configuration regarding the rerouting from the US_SR_Rerouting work basket.

Issues Rectified::

1.As you suggested we have put a title by name rebalanceto show the users that they are in the rebalance screen. PFA the document attached which contains the screen shot.
2.Cancel on Rebalance : As suggested by you on clicking cancel on the confirmation popup its navigating back to the rebalance screen.
3.After selecting the operators in the list view clicking the rebalance button will throw up a confirmation pop up. When the user clicks cancel it will navigate to the previous rebalance screen.

3. Do we need to display the Reasons for Rebalancing in the Change availabilty or in the Rebalance Screen?
4. In the story it is mentioned that "The system will retain the report for reprint and/or refresh". can you please elicit what is the exact requirement here.

Jeff,
In the hybrid approach document, we have the following steps mentioned:
a.If the manager approves the Supporting Document Info, and chooses reject or rework and clicks submit, the process goes back to the initiator.
b.If the manager does not click the checkbox, the only options available are reject or rework and when the user clicks submit, the process goes back to the initiator.
We wanted to understand that were you referring to the existing "request follow up work" feature that the manager can use to send the work item back to the initiator or do you want us to explcitly create 2 more action items/buttons that the user can use to send for rework or reject?
In the event that the manager rejects or sends for rework, it is going back to the initiator, then why do we need two different actions?
Also, there is no status like re work for any work item? what will be the status in case an item is sent for rework(if it is any different from request for follow up- our understanding is that it should be the same)

Please let us know if you need more inputs/details in order to provide us with the necessary details?

Jeff/Duane/Brad,
we have a requirement in the story where the supporting document is to be Modal.
"This harness is modal, meaning she cannot do anything to the SR page until this harness is closed."
We did the required R&D to see what does it take to achieve this? We learnt that although we were able to go to the new screenas a pop up, we were not able to save the data that has been entered in the modal screen/new pop up with supporting document information and also do UI level validation on that. This is a result of initial analysis for few hours that we did. Please let us know if you would want us to continue with spending more efforts on doing further R&D or would the team liketo consider the alternative approach suggested below:

a) Padma opens a SR which has an uncollectible charge off amount.
b) Padma clicks on a button/link, "Click Here to Update Supporting Document" and then one section of the screen is automatically displayed(untilt the button is not clicked, it will be hidden)
c) Padma enters the required values and clicks on "Generate Supporting Document" and the document is generated attached to the work object as expected. The supporting document sections hides again and padma see the work item view.
d) Padma decides to update the supporting document , she clicks on button/link, "Click Here to Update Supporting Document" and same section pops up again and then we can repeat through steps b and c.
e) If there are any Mandatory fields that have not been updated, we will throw a UI level error that would ask her to enter the mandatory fields.Once she fills them up as expected and clicks on "Generate Supporting Document", the system works as expected.
It would be great if we could get the direction from ITG/Business to either do more research on the modal screen or begin with work on the alternative approach above, the offshore development team working on this story will be able to make some progress. If not, we will not be a show stopper.

Please let me know if you need more inputs to answer this.

I expect this information to be displayed on a screen that has not yet been designed whose purpose will be to hold the following information.Site (Unit from operatorpxCreateOperator from Rebalance object)
Rebalance Date (pxCreateDateTime from Rebalance objectformatted mm/dd/yyyy)
Reason (new field on Rebalance Object)
Approver (Manager Operator Name from Rebalance Object entered free form)

2014-12-20 16:44:35.6830 Content is Clarifications regarding the Layout Screen 

Hi Duane/Jeff/Brad,
Thanks for the updates provided for the earlier Clarifications. We have some more queries that needs to be addressed. Please correct us if we are wrong in our approach
Section 1::
Is this the input criteria for the report that needsto be generated?We feel that the reason should be entered in the Rebalance screen before we actually do the rebalancing rather than capturing during the Report.Do you want the reason to be entered in a text field or it should be a selection.


Section 4::
Tech team feels that they need do to a spike on displaying the summary view in the same screen where the list view is displayed (Section 2 & Section 3)Do you want the rebalance report as part of the report tab in the portal as in COD currently or do you want this one to be generated after clicking the "rebalance" button in the rebalance screen

Retain/Refresh Clarification::
Regarding this approach the Tech team has some clarifications which they will point out during the call.
Please let me know if you need any additional info to address the above queries.
Regards
Tilak

Workgroup- "PYORIGUSERWORKGROUP" from SAM_Work table.
 Unit -"PYORIGORGUNIT" from SAM_Work tableCan you pls confirm our understanding that this is the unit/workgroup we need to demonstrate in the report? there are other units which has PYRESOLVEUNIT/Work group.. based on your inputs, we understand that it will be initiator's unit/workgroup.

2014-12-20 16:44:39.3040 Content is Rebalance Work Flow and Screen Shots 

Rebalancing Process Flow::

As of today we are having two separate links in the Rebalance 1)Change availability 2)Rebalance. For the ease of development we have broken it in to 2 stories.

But when the development is complete the Rebalance harness will have the following screens and flow. Please correct us if there is any deviation in the flow

Currently we have " View Reports" in the interaction manager. Do you want to include Rebalance reports as part of that or do you want to include it separtely in the Rebalance harness. Please confirm.

The flow mentioned below is based on the assumption that "reports" will be integral part of the rebalance harness. If we confirm us we will update the flow accordingly.

The Rebalance Portal will have two links
oRebalance



Rebalance :
When the user clicks the Rebalance the first screen will be the one where he enters the reasons to do rebalancing
Once the user enters the reasons and submits it will take the user to change availability screen where he/she enters the inputs and then clicks submit
Upon clicking submit the user will be taken to Rebalance screen where he does the rebalance. Before doing the rebalance the "view button" will be disabled. Once he clicks the rebalance button the userwill get a confirmation screen. On clicking "close" the user will be navigated back to "rebalance screen" and the "View Report" button will be activated.
When the user clicks theview report button he will be able to see the report for the rebalance which is done at that time



We designed the screen where we give input for doing the rebalance. Please review it and let us know if any further changes needs to be incorporated.

Please refer to the "Rebalance Screen Shot on 18-02-2009.doc" in the attachment section.

Jeff,
As we were implementing the story today we had a question that poped up.
We understand that all the fields on the source document are going to be entered by Padma. However, just so that we understand the process better, we wanted to know how will Padma enter the Approver's signature/Approver's name/Amount/Approve date ,etc? I would assume that one or more of these fields will have to be auto populated based on something that has happened to the work item in the past. Can you pls let us know if there are any fields that are to be auto populated/made uneditable on the source document?

Jeff,
Currently, if an account does not have a co- buyer information (fetched from CARS) , Padma still has an option to select "Mark letter undeliverable to - None" indicating on UI that the letter can be sent to both buyer and co-buyer(implementation from R1). However, as per our implementation, if there is no co-buyer information existing today, we are not generating the letter for co-buyer. Do you feel that there is some kind of an incosistency here? Padma should not be allowed to select "Mark letter undeliverable to - None- Letter will be sent to both" if there is no co buyer information for that account?

This is regarding displaying the Assignee name in the list view. This report will be generated immediately after doing the rebalance. But the SLA's will run in intervals. So by the time we generate the report may be the work item may not yet assigned to anyone.
Please clarify on the same whether we need to display Assignee name in the report or not.

  We tried with Iframes but still some analysis has to be doneto implement this inour application.
 As a work around if the printer option is set to "as laid out on screen" the print out will have the title along with the report.

Can the Supervisor or Manager make any changes to fields on the Charge Off other then the comment field when the charge off is being Reviewed or Approved?

My understanding was that they can make comments and send back for rework or approve but that they cannot make changes to the charge off fields beyond that.

Please confirm or correct the above statements.

We understand from the comment above that for a Total loss type of a work item we need to route it through Supervisor, our question here would be:
a) Does the Supervisor see the reason for uncollectible in his review screen too? <My guess would be that he has to but wanted to confirm with the SMEs before taking up the task>
b) If we are displaying the field for reason to the supervisor, does it need to be read only?

All,
We would like to request for inputs for the following questions to help us estimate better for these story:
a) We can send the work item for follow up in the corresponding Rejections work basket. Should we assume that we will use the Initiator's Unit and Workgroup to determine where the work item should go if rejected by the Fulfiller?
b) After making the changes to the SR as requested by Fulfiller, where will the persona doing the follow up send the work item to? Do we have to re route it using the distribution logic built in R1?
c) From our understanding of R1+R2, we think that SHAW is not passing the Unit number to SAM. Have we confirmed from SHAW that they are providing us that information? How will we identify the unit for SRs(all collection types) that are going to be created out of SHAW?

2014-12-20 16:44:56.4490 Content is Some key discussion points while discussing the story-24-Feb 

All,
Just keeping a note of what we learnt about the story today:
a) Some of the CRM-Rejections work basket will be used for routing HRC type(only- Not applicable for total loss and special collection) charge off work items for follow up by Padma
b) As a direct result of a) there could be work items of both the type Charge off and a Service request that will be contained in the work basket. We should assume that the user knows how to sort out the SR/COD work items and do the follow up work as required.
c) Chris the collector will have access to all the SR or COD work items in a particular work basket if he has the required access to that work basket. We dont need to filter out the contents of the work basket based on role.
d) Once the follow up work is done and the follow up processor clicks on "Submit", the HRC work item will be approved(as already built in R1) and will go to the Process charge off work basket/
e) Charge off is only for US.

2014-12-20 16:44:56.6120 Content is Some follow up questions on the story 

Jeff,
a) Please help us understand where would the follow up processor for HRC work out of? What does his UI look like? We know that there is a screen/UI for creation of HRC work item. Do we assume that this screen/UI will be used to make the modifications?
b) From the business perpective, how would SHAW know the changes that are made as a part of follow up work for HRC in SAM?

2014-12-20 16:44:56.7770 Content is Adding one more question to the above discussion 

In addition to the above questions, how do we forsee the follow up processor making the changes to the SR? Do we need more Screens/UI for him to do the needful? Is there something that is existing in R1 that will be used and we would not need to do anything to route the work items?

1.What kind of view is expected in the Site/WorkGroup_Rejection Workbasket?
2.Do you want to follow the similar view what is adapted for normal workbasket? If we append any additional info to the existing list view of the work basket it will affect all the work basket's view. We cannot customize the list viewas per work basket. As it is mentioned that we need to display site number it would affect all the other workbaskets.
3.Do you want to have any access level control on the rejection work baskets?

1.When Padma the processor is working on a workitem and finds that some more info is required. She will select 'request follow up' to yes and submits. At this point should the workitem be routed to Padma's Site_Workgroup_Rejection workbasket or to the Chris Site_Workgroup_rejection workbasket?If the answer to the first question isChris Site_Workgrou_rejection workbasket then infuture after SAM R2 Collections goes live, the SR's will be created by XML and the name that will is coming as of today in R2 is hardcoded"GIFSAMR2". This needs to be modifiedso that we will receive the appropriate operator name to whom the work item should be routed.We are dealing with different applications SHAW,GIF, SAM, CARS currently.can weassume that all the opeator's ids are in sync across all these applications?

Answers:
A) Yes
b) For a SR it gets noted and then closed. If it is a Charge off once it gets submitted it thengoes back into Padma's workbasket and follows the normal flow.
c) Dawn will followup with SHAW on her request for the unit information. Dawn will also talk with Bob Sutton to verify that SHAW is actually passing us the unit information.

1. Same view as we have in the existing rejection workbasket today.
2. Yes you the same view. The business is going to remove the requirement to add the site number to the rejection workbasket view.
3. New rejection workbaskets will need to be available in the dropdown list for assigning workbaskets to a operator.

Section 1 & Section 2:

For the skillet mappingnew SKILLSET table will be created in oracle with the following columns
Process
Primary Skill
Secondary Skills.

From the SAM_WORK table the process value will be picked up and it will be mapped to the SKILLSET table to get the skills corresponding to the process.

Clarification needed:For example -Incase If 100 users are selected for rebalancing, all the 100 values needs to be passed to the SQL query. I need to check whether PEGA is having any limitations to pass these user values

At the maximum of how many users can be selected during rebalancing.?
.

Section 4 :

I am trying to create 4 sections to display the 4 different summaries of this section.
These sections will have the repeated layout with page list which is getting the values from a stored procedure.

If the above one didnt work I will go for a summary view report.
If I go for a summary view report implementation of the 4 summaries will be in the following layout

2014-12-20 16:45:00.7850 Content is Response to Some follow up questions on the story 

a) the follow up processor for HRC work should have a UI that looks just like the UI that Padma has but the HRC processor should be able to change whatever fields are on the UI.
b) From the business perspective, Shaw will not know that changes have been made in SAM to a HRC. The business will have login rights for both SHAW and SAM and will therefore be able to refer to both seperately if a complete understanding is necessary.,

Do we need to display all the rejection_workbaskets available to all the operators? or its going to be Site/Workgroup speicific.- For testing purposes have some ID's setup to see muliple rejection workbaskets and othe ID's setup to see one specific rejection workbasket.
If its specific please provide us a list of the operator ids to which the 'rejection_workbasket's needs to be associated and also the list of the workbaskets that needs to be associated with the individual operator_id's- Specific ID's are not required. Use any ID's available in the system.

1. Follow up requests from Padma should be sent to the Site_Workgroup_rejection workbasket for Chris the Collector.
2. Brad verified that the SHAW request XML Schema passes the ShawUserID which is the GMAC ID. In production, the SAM operator ID is also the GMAC ID. This will allow us to create the SR using the ShawUserID from the XML request and then turn around in Pega and do a look up of the Unit for that ID.
3. As far as we can see, the SHAW User ID is the GMAC ID and the Pega Operator ID is the GMAC ID and all of these are provided by CORE ID as part of the single sign on mechanism. As for CARS, I believe that they use a different identification mechanism.

Jeff,
Thanks for the clarifications.
As per Brad reply we understood that the ShawUserID that is same as SAM operator ID. And it is goign to come in the Drop down when Request follow up is selected to Yes and proceeding with the development.
For Chris Site_workgroup_rejection workbasket we are referring the Xcel sheet that has been prepared as part of the Rejection Workbasket -US user story assuming that Chris will be associated to one of the rejection workbaskets.
The above are for our understanding. Please let us know if we are following the right approach.

2014-12-20 16:45:07.7680 Content is Availability vs. Rebalance clarification (Regards to operators query question) 

The two processes we have defined are 1) making an operator available or unavailable, or 2) rebalancing the work for one or more operators. In the case of #2, anytime an operator is selected, the work in that user's worklist that fits the status criteria will always be rerouted back to the routing workbasket, regardless if the operator is available or unavailable. When the items get routed from the Workbasket back to the worklists, then the rules that govern whether a user gets items is based on their availability.
Let me know if you have any questions on this.

How would the Language of the letter come from?
Lsz response -The information for systematically generated letters had indicated that theLanguage Indicatorpassed from CARS would be leveraged.
a)At this time, from a COD letter perspective  only Branch 599 accounts where the Language Indicator is S or Spanish, the Spanish letter is generated.
b)The current SAM Document Generation menu system only presents the option for letter language based upon a manual selection at the time the letter is being generated.
c)Going forward, the frame work for the Document Generation perspective will need to offer the option for a letter to be generated in the language of the customers preference (French/English forCanadaor English/Spanish for US)


b)Matured/Not Matured Indicator come from CARS/Pega? Or do we continue to hard code it please?
Lsz response - The CARS fields necessary to determine if a vehicle term has matured or not is based upon the account type.
For Retail and Retail FFP Account Types, the Final-Pmt-Dt: in CARS the Estimated Final Payment Date: field which is mapped to the HOME tab in SAM.

If the letter is generated prior to this date, it is not considered matured. If it is generated on or after this date, the matured letter is generated.
For Lease Account Types in CARS, the SC-END field in CARS and in SAM on the HOME tab Scheduled End Date.
i.If the letter is generated prior to this date for lease agreement 8 contracts the unmatured letter is generated

iii.If the letter is generated prior to 29 days to this date for lease agreement 9 contract, the unmatured letter is generated

Good Day Tilak and Akshat,
Per our conversation, please find on the attachment section the account types divided by the SmartLease/Lease, SmartBuy/Balloon or Retail category. The spreadsheet also includes all of the termination codes available in CARS. Please note that while the list is all inclusive, it does not supersede the termination codes provided for the COD process flow.

All,
Recently, there was a question on how will the follow up processor access the rejections workbasket and how will the screen/UI look like when he opens up the rejecte work item.The attachment "View of rejections work basketv1.0-AJ-02-Mar.doc"here gives a view of how will a follow up processor(of any kind of role) access the rejections work basket and the view of the work item when opened in a rejected mode. This will help the offshore team in understanding and developing the system. Please review and correct/add as required.

Jeff/Brad,
I had a discussion with Jeannie, and she wanted to check and validate that assumption"As per Brad reply we understood that the ShawUserID that is same as SAM operator ID. And it is goign to come in the Drop down when Request follow up is selected to Yes and proceeding with the development" with Dawn. This assumption may not be true.
Jeannie,
Pls confirm if the assumption stated above is true. This will determine the rejection work basket that the work item has to be routed to.

2014-12-20 16:45:23.0900 Content is Update on the mapping -28-Jan- Discussion with Linda 

Jeff Jurado/Jeff Dahlberg,
We had a follow up discussion with Linda this afternoon and here is an update on the responses posted above:
1) If we receive a Language indicator as "S", "SPA" or "Spanish"/"code-TBD" as a part of the LANG in GIF-CARS interface. The branch no will not have any implications for the systematic generation story. We will determine the code that is used. Else we will use English language for letter generation.The Point b & care not applicable for the systematic letter generation-post charge off ("The current SAM Document Generation menu system only presents the option for letter language based upon a manual selection at the time the letter is being generated.)
c)Going forward, the frame work for the Document Generation perspective will need to offer the option for a letter to be generated in the language of the customers preference (French/English forCanadaor English/Spanish for US)"
2) Brad/Sundar/Prasanta/Badri- Can you please confirm on where this intelligence of determining the maturity needs to be built , in Pega or Adobe? In my opinion, it would be Pega since R2 letters is getting the indicator from SHAW, the source system. As per Linda's comments, there will be no difference between a matured and a not matured account for the post charge off letters but we need to build that intelligence in the system for future use
3)While systematically generating the letter ,if the account type is lease or balloon , we will generate the lease post charge off letter which is referred as "Skip Letter".
Linda,
Pls review and confirm if i have added something inaccurately.

Akshat

Team,
As per my discussions with Jeannie, we will need to add another attribute to the output of the report which will be the work group of the initiator. Hence instead of just displaying origination site, we also need to display origination site and work group.
Offshore team,
Please add a task if required to accomplish this and add it as a part of the output of the report
Jeff/Daune,
Please let me know if there are any concerns.

2014-12-20 16:45:26.3790 Content is Clarification on using SIte no for routing to rejections workbasket 

All,
We understand the following routing logic for rejections work basket:
Main flow:
Please look out for the Unit and work group of the initiator who created this SR in SHAW (assuming he has been set up in SAM too) and use that combination to send it to the rejections workbasket
Alternative Flow
If the User id is not set up in SAM, use the Site no associated with the work item(this will come from SHAW) and use that to determine the rejections workbasket

Our question is that today the same site no is associated with more than 1 rejections workbasket.
For e.g. 311 as site no maps to
KnoxvilleAdministration Center
and
KnoxvilleCommercial Remarketing

Similarly for 684, 622,etc.
Now if we were to receive a SR where the user in SHAW is not set up in SAM , we will use the site no to determine which rejections workbasket to send the work item to. If the site no is 311, which rejections work basket do we send it to ? admin center or remarketing? Please correct us if our understanding is incorrect somewher and advise

We learnt from R2 team that Site no is not a mandatory fields for a SR coming from SHAW. As a worst case scenario,
what logic would we use to determine the rejections workbasket if the site no is not available(non-mandatory) and if the inititaor/user id creating the SR in SHAW is not set up in SAM?
Is this possible?

How do we determine whether the lease is type 8 or type 9?
If the letter is generated prior to this date for lease agreement 8 contracts the unmatured letter is generated
ii.If the letter is generated on or after this date for lease agreement 8 contracts, the matured letter is generated.
iii.If the letter is generated prior to 29 days to this date for lease agreement 9 contract, the unmatured letter is generated
iv.If the letter is generated on or after the 28thday prior to this date for lease agreement 9 contracts, the matured letter is generated

Folks,Talked to Jeannie on understanding her opinion on the error message that is thrown out after the personas were allowed to select the HRC-SR.She opened up the foundation role structure spread sheet and pointedout that we should basically revoke thataccess. She said we should rather not give the option for Supervisor and Managers of the COD system to create a COD SR for total loss and special collections orespectively.It is relatively better than throwing an error out after letting the user select that option, as predicted.This has a dependency and may require update on the foundation role structure of SAMHowever, it depends on the technical team to come up with the feasibility and complexity/tasks for this story and get back to us with their opinion.Regards,Akshat

We told her that we are/will beworking on that logic.For the special collections-add charge off types story , they just asked to test it for lease and said that one shouldnt see those options. We said we do not have lease account no as i learnt.

We learnt from business that Site no is a mandatory field for all SRs that are coming out of SHAW be it COD-HRC work items or other SAM-CRM work items. We need to use Site no for these SR/COD work items to determine the rejections work basket. sFor the SRsinitiated out of SHAW,we have a list of site nos that are unique for the unit + workgroup combinations for SRs.
For all the SRs that are initiated out of SAM, we need to use the initiator's unit plus work basket combination to determine the rejections workbasket
The technical team will/are working on the approach to include that logic and determine if it is feasible or not..

For testing purposes, we need to be really careful on what the time zones that get selected on operators are. The above table provides an understanding of the etc/GMT... timezones. For purposes of testing, it is perferable to have an explicit timezone set, e.g. EST, CST, etc.

2014-12-20 16:45:40.6930 Content is Clarification received from linda on 06-mar for maturity indicator 

All,
We observed that there are no variations of a lease post charge off letter based on the maturity indicator. Also, the lease post charge off letter has to be generated for lease and balloon account types. Hence, we discussed with Linda and decided that we do not have to build the logic for maturity indicator for lease and balloon type as stated in the notes above. Offshore team will work on programming the logic to determine the maturity indicator only for retail account type.

Please let us know, if any one disagrees with the notes above

2014-12-20 16:45:43.4520 Content is Consent on approach suggested by Dev Team 

All,
I had a discussion with Jeannie on this story and talked to her about the option of removing the "charge off" option from the "select intent" drop down that comes after account search. With the removal of the charge off option for TL and SC supervisors and managers , they would not have an option to create any type of COD requests. However, they could create other types of SRs that may be available based on the operator set up.
Please let us know if anyone disagrees.

2014-12-20 16:45:43.8020 Content is Addition of an business rule to the story 

All,
I had a discussion with the story owner to understand if there were any scenarios where the flow mentioned in the story should have any exceptions? The rationale behind asking this question was th understanding of how all the systems work in sync and why would we need to have an exception flow.
Jeannie told us that , if Padma selects follow up required as "YES" and clicks on Submit, we need not show the two pop up messages as outlined in the story and allow the work item/COD-SR to flow to the follow up work basket. Only if Padma does not select as follow up required, will we have one warning message popup saying "Did you check for outstanding personal property taxes if the garaging address or contract state = Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia or West Virginia? and if Padma clicks on Yes again then "Did you check for outstanding open items". If padma selects a NO for any of these two questions we should not let her submit the work item/resolve it "if follow up required is NO".
Duane/Jeff,
Please let us know if this should go as a back log or should the team work on it as a part of this iteration?
Offshore team,
Based on the response from Duane/Jeff,please do the technical feasibility stiudy, if required and add a task to build this additional logic. Please let us know if you have any questions.

As per Dawn's comment on the daily stand up call on 5th Mar'09 , we should display "all the statuses that are present in the work basket " in production. A couple of error related statuses mentioned here are due to the dev/sit related environment and one should ideally not see these statuses in production. Resolved completed/Resolved would never be in a workbasket as they would have been sent for archival.

In the process charge off screen, Padma has to select a value from the drop down from the list to determine whom the letter should be sent to(Mark Address undeliverable to). This has to be constructed dynamically based on whether or not the account has a co-buyer or not
Scene1: Both Buyer/Customer and Co-Buyer/Co- Customer are present for an account
The options padma would have are : None, Both, Co-Buyer, Buyer
Scene2:Only Buyer/Customeris present for an account
The options padma would have are : None(send the letter to the buyer only), Buyer(Do not send any letter)
We are assuming that each account will have atleast a customer associated.

Thanks for the updates. We went through the attachment and we would like to clarify a few points here.
We are going to do the rebalancing for only a particular site and a workgroup in COD 1.Multiple sites and workgroups along with the skill based rebalancing will be handled as part of COD2 releaseThe matrix that is there at the end of the document is a report of skill based rebalancing which will also be handled in COD2. Is that is the final format of the report that is expected or there are some modifications to it. And also do you want to append this report in the rebalance report itself or its goign to be a separte report?

Business agreed to one site at this point.
Multiple workgroups, roles and skills are part of COD1.
The report for the listing of work items and counts is fine. The matrix was only there to illustrate how we count the work items. The business wants to go with option 1, where skill counts match the worktiem count.

Linda feedback - Please note that none of the letters contained in SAM are supposed to be using the Shaw codes. The letters are Pre Charge Off, Post Charge Off or Post Charge Off Maturity and should be pointed to the proper locations based upon the SAM letter names. This was a defect from SAM/ShawR2 that was addressed and correctedin UAT. Please ensure that the corrections made in R2 UAT are passed onto theCODPost Charge Off letters.

Thanks for updating the document. The technical team went through the documents attached and came up with some queries. Please correct us if we are wrong in our understading.
 Roles:- Are we referring to Pega defined Access Roles or Business Defined Roles to the user.Roles:- What is the significance of roles with respect to User Availability and Rebalancing.Skills:- For User Availability, we can fetch the operators having the all the skills selected, In Case of Rebalancing,we are havingissue in the mapping of the skills and Work Items.In the latest document updated in Version 1, it is mentioned that Skills are dependent on Roles and Roles are dependent on WorkGroups. Have to check the mappingand interdependency on that. Supervisor or a Manager do not have skills mapped to them, in that case how to change the availability/rebalance these users (as they would never be listed).Mapping:- In the Work Item information, we do have a property which maintain the information of the process the items belong to.Now, in a data table we have a mapping of Process + list of Primary Skill and Secondary Skill. A process can have a list of multiple skill so to make out which exact skill was used

As per the latest CR : CR Reject Option for SHAW charge offs which says that, Padma the processor if she wants to reject a SR she can go for 'Reject' option in Request follow up drop down - Process Change off screen.

As of now the pop up messages wont be displayed if Padma has selected the follow up to "yes". This is also applicable when she selects "reject' option as she is completely rejecting the SR. Do you want us to go ahead add the task and implement it or wait till the CR is implemented in R2. Please suggest us.

All,
We just wanted to confirm and proceed with the work on this story our following assumption:
a) Site no is going to be mandatory field for all SRs created out of SHAW.
b) If site no is present for a SR, we will use that information to determine the rejections workbasket else we will use the initiator's unit+ work group(this will be typically all SRs initiated in SAM)
c) There will never be a scenario where both the site no and Initiator's unit are both absent for a SR because Site no is mandatory and initiators information is present if a SR created in SAM. We dont have to program for any default routing in case either information is not available.

Please correct us if there is something that has been captured inaccurately.

Will there be a SR in a US workbasket for a Canadian account ever? Let us know if this makes any sense and if it does, what would be your inputs for us please?

Regards,
Akshat

Comment from Linda Zylstra:
Please note thatD1191 Generating a SKIP LEASE letter still generates Low balance charge off letter,is not a defect as stated.The Lease Charge Off letter is a Post Charge Off  Matured or a Post Charge Off  Not Matured for any qualifying charge off types generated in SAM.The letter was built as part of Release 2 but needs to be updated based upon the feedback received from GM Legal on 3/6.

The defect may be that the correct content of the letter is not available. Will attempt to generate a Lease Charge Off to determine letter content to ascertain that the correct letter is being generated.

2014-12-20 16:46:04.5190 Content is Response to Confirmation for routing logic 

Team,
We had a discussion with Jeff D and following is the logic to be used for routing to rejections work basket:
a) To determine if a SR was created out of SHAW , we need to check if SHAWGUID!= Null
If SHAW GUID!=Null then we should understand that it is a SHAW generated SR (For a SR created out of SHAW , the GUID will never be null because it is a system generated value and is mandatory). We should use the site no = "Branch no"from one of the pages in clipboard to determine the rejections workbasket(this is a mandatory field too for all SRs coming out of SHAW)

If SHAW GUID = Null then we should understand that it is a SAM generated SR and we should then use the initiator's unit and work group information to determine the rejections workbasket.

There will be no scenario where both the initiator's unit and work group information and site no both will be absent . Hence we do not have to worry about creating a routing logic for a default scenario

Jeff D,
Thank you for helping us with the information. Please review and correct if required.

Offshore team,
Please let us know if any further inputs are required.

Regards,
Akshat


We know that any SR that is initiated from SHAW. There is a property on the pypage and if SHAW GUID != null then its a SHAW transaction. It is a mandatory field. If it exists then there is a property called branch id is the id to use for determining the rejections work basket.

Then we will use the operators unit and work group combinations

If the SR is coming from SHAW, the site number will be used to decide on theworkbasket.In case of HRC when we do the request follow upthe user has to be selected manually from the dropdown byPadma the processor eventhough it is not getting used in the workbasket identification logic. Is business ok with this implementation?

2014-12-20 16:46:07.9380 Content is Feedback on demonstration of the story on 20th March 

We had an opportunity to demonstrate the US rejetions work basket story to the business and here are the observations:a) The input screen should just be a list of work baskets with check boxes where the user can select and click on submit. On which it should go to the output screen. Currently the list of workbaskets selected goes into a text area like a comment block and is appended to each other. I am assuming that it is perhaps due to the dev UI but typically, it would be as described in the 1st line.b) Dawn wanted to know if ever there will be a work item that will get routed/posted in Admin work baskets apart from GMAC-Canada and Semperian and if so, we would need the capability to show those work baskets as an input selection criteria in the input screen. As discussed on the call today, if it is feasible to show those work baskets, it would be great. Otherwise it will be only the work baskets that come under GMAC-Semperian.c) Just wanted to reiterate that we should have list ofrejections work baskets in the input screen tood) "Received " is misspelled in one of the output column headers.Except for this observation , the report looks good from the presenatation perspective, the data integrity was not something that one can approve of which is fair. We need to present a demo where we select one of the CRM work baskets fordrill down rather than the process charge off work basket. Please help us by providing the demo that contains selection of rejections workbasket and CRM workbasket.

As per the call today, we discussed that:
a) The input screen for selection of work baskets and display of the same in a text areais not the most convenient way to show the information on what is selected. Duane will add a point to the product backlog to ensure that we do not carry forward this look for future reports.
b) Dawn is ok with not looking at a demo based on selection of CRM work basket. As per offshore,it will work the same way for selection of any work baskets

All,
We had an opportunity to discuss with Dawn to understand the set of work baskets that should come in at the input screen for this report. The system has primararily three groups of workbasket out of which we are supposed to include only GMAC: Semperian and GMAC:Admin.
GMAC:admin consists of work basket that are under pega.com group and are used by the system in case of some technical exceptions,etc. Dawn wanted us to provide the capability to see the list of SRs that are stuck in that workbasket just so that we could respond to the error. We did notify Dawn that we are not sure as to what kind of details can be expected to come as a part of the report when the input workbasket is any of the exceptions workbasket group. Dawn said she should be fine with some information not being displayed as long as we are able to identify it.
GMAC:Semperian will consist of all CRM(USonly) workbaskets in addition to the rejections workbasket.
Dawn,
Please let us know if you disagree with something written here.

2014-12-20 16:46:11.9660 Content is Letter supression Borrower/Co-borrower stay at same address 

Duane/Jeff/Brad,
While generating a letter for an account that has only one owner ( i,e only Customer and no Co-buyer ), the only possible value for the field 'Mark letter undeliverable for:' is 'Customer'. But the values in the 'Mark letter undeliverable for:' drop down list has None, Customer, Co-Signer and Both.The values in the drop-down field need to change according to number of the customers associated with the account currently being used.
How to address the supression if the customer and co-buyer both reside at the same address. In this case Adobe is anyway going to send only one letter. But what are the values that should come in the drop down when we want to supress the letter generation.?

Offshore team,
The answer to your question is posted below:

The logic to dynamically populate the mark Address undeliverable for drop down:

1)If Buyer and Co-Buyer are both applicable for an account and if they have different address:
a)The Drop down will all 4 values: Buyer, co buyer, none and both. The default selection being None.
b)the check box will be defaulted to the message that is corresponding to None
c)2 letters will be generated if None was selected

2)If Buyer and Co-Buyer are both applicable for an account and if they have sameaddress:
a)The Drop down will have only 2 values: None and both. The default selection being None.
b)the check box will be defaulted to the message that is corresponding to None
c)1 letter with both the names of buyer and co- buyer will be generated if None was selected

3)Only Ifa Buyer was applicable for an account :

a)The Drop down will have only 2 values: None and Buyer. The default selection being None.
b)the check box will be defaulted to the message that is corresponding to None
c)1 letter will be generated if None was selected

The Signature Block consists of the following:
1.Blank space for the signature
2.Picture of the signature
3.Employee Name
4.Employee Title
5.Phone Number
6.Fax Number(Canadaonly, will be brand website for US)
7.Email address (Canadaonly)
Phone numbers can be broken out into 3 different categories:
1.Personalized
2.Generic
3.Overridden (Specialized)
Generic vs Personalized signature block to be define on the user profile in Pega.
If the user profile is set to generic, it should select the general phone number for the users site.
The Override (Specialized) signature block to be defined on a letter by letter basis.Examples would be where the presidents name and info appears on the letter, or bankruptcy letters that come from an individual.
The phone number has been moved from within the body of the letter to under the signature block
If the phone number is personalized on the letter, but the phone number is blank on the user profile, the phone number will default to the brand CSC.
Extension numbers only apply to national?If an extension number exists on the user profile, then the extension will be printed on the letter.If no extension number appears, then nothing will be printed on the letter.
Business is identifying the groupings of the letters so that they can define similar phone numbers to use for specific groups (for example, bankruptcy, collections, etc)
All phone numbers need to be table driven (so if changes occur, they can happen in one place w/o having to change multiple letters), but the rules to identify which number to use will have to be done on a letter by letter basis.Several phone numbers can be pulled from the IW (Information Warehouse).
Some wording on the story needs to change.Anywhere that refers to a generic phone number will be changed to general.
In reference to the account type, when the account type is a lease, retail, etc, the account type general phone number will appear on the letter.
There is one ARC inCanadaand one ARC in theUS.
How are envelops called in SAM when someone needs to locally print a letter?Does this mean when SAM is printing a return envelop?Click for local print in Pega doesnt appear to work well.Reprint should re-route back to the print vendor.

Return Addresses, like phone numbers should be table driven, for quick and easy changes.
The rules to define which return address to use need to be defined on a letter by letter basis.
The return addresses will be listed on the master spreadsheet that Linda has created.
For PPC return addresses, we should leverage what is already built.
2 different types of return addresses are on the letter:
1.(brand) return address in top left corner of theletter.
2.Remittance address  where info (payments) get sent back to
Solution needs to be flexible enough to identify countries and make changes quickly
A change control process to make edits to letter information (return addresses, phone numbers, etc) will need to be developed.Will this process be in Pega?If so, maybe a control panel will need to be created to update any changes.However, if Pega were to get systematic feeds on a regular basis, the updates would come automatically instead of manually.TOG needs to have a technical spike with architects to see what the best solution would be.

Please let us know what scenario it failed so that we will replicate the same here. Also, Unit must be Roseville and WorkGroup must be Bankruptcy as we created the rejection workbasket based on this combination as per the excel provided for creating rejection workbasket.

Based on our discussion with SMEs on 07th Apr, on selection of"Reject" and clicking on Submit, the user should not see the pop up messages and there should be no check for mandatory fields of supporting document. If the user selects reject, we should obviously not generate e-mail, generate supporting document, generate letter.

As of now the manual Retrywill be delivered , thereport & auto retry will be delivered later.
For system errors the workitems will be routed to retry workbasket and the sustain team will be notified by email , the sustain team will run the retry activity which will resubmit all the workitems to Adobe.
For the application errors the processor will be notified by email and the processor will resume the flow after fixing the application error.

2014-12-20 16:46:55.2000 Content is Discussion with Brad on 10 April 2009 - Response 

The first two bullets are correct.
For the third bullet, we changed the process such that all errors will go to sustain. The reason is that 1) we should have data validation on the page prior to generating the letter, and 2) if we do have some data error, it will probably take a bit of time to figure out where the issue is. For now, let's generate the error email to Sustain only.

Observations in S-4600
The body of the email always says Customer & Co-Customer.
Hi,
The work object CO-XXXX failed to generate a valid Adobe letter for theCustomer and Co-Customer. The error that occurred was: The Adobe server is unavailable. Please check the work object and attempt to submit this letter at the earliest possible timeframe.
Thank you.
GMAC Team 
But there are instances where there will be only one customer even then the body of the email is showing customer and co-customer.

Please let us know is it okay if we just have the reason for the failure rather than saying customer and Co-customer?

Duane,

The WB "PhoenixSpecialCollectionCenter_SpecialAccountHandling_Rejections" has been trimmed so that this WB can be added into the Workbasket list of an operator. The new name is as follows -"PhoenixSplCollCtr_SplAccHandling_Rejections".
The reason for the change is that the workbasket name is too big and getting trimmed off.

While I agree that a number of the steps appeared to pass, but during the testing for Case 7: Control string creation fails due to code error or Db error while accessing envelope codeswe made an observation that old items were not consistently being moved into the resume_charge off work basket.

Based upon this, the testing results are not passed as there is a need to determine how we are going to address these items as they are being placed back into the Process Chargeoff Workbasket.As per our conversation this morning, I will be entering these observations on the story 4600 in Version One.Once, Prasanta has proved the query information regarding the accounts that are currently in the workbasket with the message of Resolved-Pending Letter Gen.

The rest of the testing is to determine the impacts to the items that are placed back into Padmas workbasket, the sustain activity and the control file output for testing from yesterday and today.
Pega_Adobe_4600 Word document contains the screenshots from the 5/7/2009 testing results but the file is too big to upload to Version One.

Duane/Jeanne,
Please find below the list of questions that needs to be addressed as part of the story.
1. In Employee report, should the dropdown display only the list of Processors as Employees? The reason for asking this question is "updated from (Approved to Resolved)" will be applicable only for processors.

2. Let us consider the following scenario:
 a. A charge-off comes to the appoved state and stays in the common Process-Charge-Off Work basket for 24 hours.
 b. Then a processor takes the charge-off and resolves it in 5 minutes.
 c. Now if we consider the Process time as per the present logic, it isProcess Time = Resolved State time - Approved State time.
 ie., 24 hours and 5 minutes.
 d. Here the processor has taken only 5 minutes. However in the report it will show that the charge off took 24 hrs to be resolved and this will reflect in the average process time of the employee as well.
e. In a similar way if a processor starts workign on a work item that just came to process charge off work basket and resolves it in 1 hour then his process time is only 1 Hour. though the previous user resolved it in 5 minutes as we are adding the time that it stayed in the work basket his performance is not up to the mark. The reason for askingthis quesiton is as such the reports measures the productivity of a employee.

3. If after approved state, a charge off is sent for Req followup. Then it will come to approved state again. Now if it is resolved, do we have to consider process time as the time between the first time it came for approval(ignoring the second time it came for approval) and the time it got resolved? In this case also, without the fault of the employee, his/her average process time may show more in the report.
Please let us know if you need add inputs to address the same.

1. In Employee report, should the dropdown display only the list of Processors as Employees? The reason for asking this question is "updated from (Approved to Resolved)" will be applicable only for processors.

Yes, the dropdown should display only a list of Processors. Make sure that we include Employees that have "ProcessChargeOff" workbasket.


2. Let us consider the following scenario:
 a. A charge-off comes to the appoved state and stays in the common Process-Charge-Off Work basket for 24 hours.
 b. Then a processor takes the charge-off and resolves it in 5 minutes.
 c. Now if we consider the Process time as per the present logic, it isProcess Time = Resolved State time - Approved State time.
 ie., 24 hours and 5 minutes.
 d. Here the processor has taken only 5 minutes. However in the report it will show that the charge off took 24 hrs to be resolved and this will reflect in the average process time of the employee as well.
e. In a similar way if a processor starts workign on a work item that just came to process charge off work basket and resolves it in 1 hour then his process time is only 1 Hour. though the previous user resolved it in 5 minutes as we are adding the time that it stayed in the work basket his performance is not up to the mark. The reason for askingthis quesiton is as such the reports measures the productivity of a employee.


The Process Time should be calculated as Resolved State Time - Approved State Time even though this appears to have a negative impact on average process time for an individual employee. This report is used to find process issues and make improvements to overall processing time. Outliers on an individual operators report will be researched and discussed in an effort to determine whether overall process improvements or individual processor improvementscan be made.


3. If after approved state, a charge off is sent for Req followup. Then it will come to approved state again. Now if it is resolved, do we have to consider process time as the time between the first time it came for approval(ignoring the second time it came for approval) and the time it got resolved? In this case also, without the fault of the employee, his/her average process time may show more in the report.


Same answer as #2 above. Process Time should be calculated as Resolved State Time - Approved State Time (Initial Approval, not subsequent Approvals)

We will discuss these responses with Jeanne upon her return.

2014-12-20 16:47:16.2010 Content is Additional Clarifications 

Thanks Jeff for the responses. I have one more question in reference to the discussion we had.
1. For instance Processor 1 picked up one work item from the process charge off work basketand found out that some additional information is required to resolve the work item and he sends for request follow up. The initiator/reviewer/approver who ever recieves the pending follow up work item, fills the additional details and sends for processor charge off.
2. What if Processor 2 instead of processor 1 picks up the work item from the process charge off work basket and start working up on it. how to calculate in this scenario as two processors are involved in this scenario. Is there any condition that the first processor who ever starts the working on a SR needs to finish up the work item as the work item after follow up will come to the workbasket and/or any processor can pick up the work item and work up on it.?
Please let us know.

2014-12-20 16:47:16.4060 Content is Response to 5/18 question 

Because the report is to measure time from Approved to Resolved, the above scenario will have no effect. Once followup is completed on a work item and returned, it is Approved when it is returned to the Process Charge Off workbasket, so it wouldn't matter which processor selects the item to work it.

Leverage story 4482 (Charge off Amount Collectible/Uncollectible report that is already built).After opening the report from the Analytics tab, there will be a dropdown menu with all the brands listed.Mel, Shawn, or Pat can select one, more than one, or all the brands.The brands that are in the menu will be based on the skills set up for Mel and Shawn.Pat will be able to see all the brands.

After the brand is selected, the report will open to the default as it does now where the user then selects the dates and period (year, day, etc.).

Columns must be added to the report for Brand and Line of Business (i.e. Retail, Lease, Balloon).

1. Do we need to have a separateReason for Entryfield for Uncollectible Adjustment field or we can levarage the existing Reason for entry uncollectible amount?
2. In the processors Screen there isa drop down
Has an uncollectible charge off/adjustment been processed? and the values are
 a. No
 b. Yes-Uncollectible Charge off
 c. Yes - Uncollectible Adjustment
Right now it is not mandatory to select the value. the processor is able to submit the work item without selecting any value. From now as we are introducing newUncollectible Adjustment Field is there any need to make it mandatory to select the value or default it to a value and the user will change according to the scenario. Right now it is blank as default. Please refer to the snapshot attached in the attachment section.
3. What are the validations that needs to be incorporated against the new Uncollectible Adjustment Field?
4. Will this field will be dynamic or static? WhatI mean to say is will this field appear only when there is a uncollectible amount entered by the user or by default the user will see this field in the UI.
5. Consider the scenario there is already a Uncollectible amount say 1000$. The user wants to decrease the value to 750$. In this context the uncollectible adjustment is a negative value which is
-250 $. How do we represent this scenario whether we need to add or subtract from the existing uncollectible amount leaving the uncollectible amount unchanged and uncollectible adjustment amount negative value. The reason for asking this question is the Total uncollectible amount is sum of (uncollectible + uncollectible adjustment)
6. Who all are having access to enter/edit Uncollectible adjustment field?

1. The logic for the source document must be removed from the Uncollectible Amount field and linked to the new Uncollectible Adjustment field. There will no longer be a Reason for entry for the Uncollectible Amount field.
2. I have written a story to remove this field altogether, so the default can be left as blank.
3. Use the same edits that are used for the Collectible Amount and Uncollectible Amount fields.
4. The Adjustment field will always show.
5. The Uncollectible Amount field and the Uncollectible Adjustment field are not related to each other (only added together for reporting purposes). There will never be a negative amount in the field.
6. The same users who have access to enter/edit the Uncollectible Amount field.

Dawn Marwin's email regarding the additions/Updations to the Mock Up.


Duane,

We had our discussion regarding the reporting story.

At this time we would like to keep theUSandCanadareporting separate. US users should only be able to pull this for US operators and Canadian users should only be able to pull this for Canadian users.

Items to note:

As discussed during the meeting the mock up/approach should reflect two paths, one for Shawn and Mel, and one for Pat the Process Owner.Shawn and Mel would first have the Brand dropdrown choice and then see a list of their operator names(not Exchange IDs).The list of names which displays should bebased on Shawn or Mels profile (Unit/Workgroup). Pat would first have the Brand, then Unit, and Workgroupdropdown selection. When they get to the operatordropdown, the names not the Exchange IDs should display based on their previous Unit and Workgroup choices.

The summary view should reflect US andCanadaseparately in the mock up.

Pending No Follow Up Required should be added as a column in the summary view

Brand should be the first dropdown choice and the brand choices displayed should be based on the user profile (ieUSuser should only see US brands and Canadian user only Canadian brands)

Open phone calls and service requests should display in the report, please confirm this is the case.

Good Morning Linda,
In the story description it is mentioned that "Theletters that are processed for Retail Account Typesmust be leveraged for the ComTRAC account types...". Please correct me if i am wrong here. ComTRAC has only lease type. So do we need to leverage Lease account type letters for developing letters for ComTRAC here rather than Retail Account type letters?
Please let us know.

2014-12-20 16:47:26.0680 Content is Additional Clarifications 

Good Morning Linda,
Though this story is to add letter generation for ComTRAC accounts while reviewing the flow for ComTRAC account we observed that
Below are the observations made by us in HRC flow for Comtrac accounts. These observations we are doing before implementing 4960.

1)At present inComTRACHRC flow when we create charge off for Comtrac accounts,the chargeoff work item is moving to ReviewProcessedComTRACChargeOff workbasket after initiator submits the work item. The status of work item in this work item is Approved.The processor picks upthe work item and submits it andthe work item will get resolved with status Resolved.
2)As the initiation screens for Comtrac and Non-Comtrac accounts are same so when we fill the uncollectible amount another text box appears. In this text box we have to fill the Reason for uncollectible amount. But when we open the work item from ReviewProcessedComTRACChargeOff workbasket uncollectible amount text box is not present.
3)Another observation we made is that whenever uncollectible amoutn is enteredthere is nosupporting document option . As we have implemented this functionality for non comtrac accounts for processors only. Do you want to implement the same for ComTRAC as well?
4)Do we need to consider the threshold logic here? If we do please provide us the flow paths and logics.
5)As we have been informed that there would be a new field name Uncollectible adjustment. Do we need to consider this in present story. If we do we need implement this for comtac?
6) If Collectible Amount = 0 there wont be any letter generation similar to non ComTRAC accounts
7) Do we need to incorporateMaturity indicator logic for ComTRAC accounts as well
8) S-04600 Story. If there is any letter generation failed do we want to have thequeuing & Reprocessinglogic implemented for ComTRAC accounts as well.

We made the assumption likethe scope of the story start after the click of the submitfromReviewProcessedComTRACChargeOffand ends with letter gen /suppression.
Please let us know your responses.

2014-12-20 16:47:26.4360 Content is Additional Clarifications 

Duane/Jeanne,
In the Story, it has been given that "there will no longer be any links from Shaw". However, the UnCollectible Adjustment field need to come from Shaw in case of HRC(Shaw Initiated). Hence necessary changes need to be done in Shaw and Shaw-SAM interface also so that they will send the Uncollectible Adjustment Amount from their end.
We would like to also confirm -
The Story states "All Source Document requirements that are linked to the Uncollectible Amount field must be removed and applied to the Uncollectible Adjustment field". Also per the Discussion in V1, "The Uncollectible Amount field and the Uncollectible Adjustment field are not related to each other (only added together for reporting purposes)".
Hence all the following support document related functionalities such as:

a. Comments by initiator.
b. Approval Supporting Doc Check box for Manager.
c. Genrerate Support Doc for Processor

will be based onUncollectible Adjustment > 0only.

Please let us know your responses.

There will be no change in the mapping of the fields from SHAW to SAM. The Uncollectible Amount in Shaw will still pass to the Uncollectible Amount field in SAM. There will be nothing passed from Shaw to the Uncollectible Adjustment field; so that field should default to zero.
Your confirmation is correct regarding the source document functionalities.

Concerns
notes about resolution given here

spaces disappearing
the current method (using a java step to split the flat file into lines) works just fine and spaces are preserved;
the exception is the trailing spaces of the T001 ("trailer") segment itself -- and it was decided we don't care.

graceful error handling
we need to investigate how to nicely deal with errors, particularly (a) reporting them back to the client and, more importantly (b) reporting all the errors we can, and not just stopping at the first problem...
I've found that it is relatively easy to trap the errors, and it doesn't take too much java to record the state information and continue; we should put out nice error messages, but that's another story

reading in XML w/o namespace(s)
I'm attempting to write a simple SOAP call to get in XML and correctly parse it; I think it will work, but I'd like to see the proof...

The GM BARS and GM VIS links should behave similar to the NADA, Kelly Blue Book links. They should open a new IE window at the given web address. Is there a particular reason these were not included under the Valuations section?
The GM BARS and GM BARS do not allow to return to the Collateral Value screen.
There is no place to enter the executory premium refunds. Exec values are not included in the calculation of the Market Values. 
There is no prompt if there is an exec value to include in the calculation.

There are several new SR's, that the creation of such, were not part of this story.
For now, all new SR's are mapped to "GMAC-SAM-Work-MilitaryCustHandling", the existing Military SR.
In summary, this effort only maps all the 8 or so different SR's to the 2 existing SR's.

Thanks for the feedback Linda.
For number 1 below, can you tell me what the business does currently with the leap years extra day? The current calculation doesnt take it into effect either. Im assuming that finance charges happen during that extra day as well. If that is the case then you are correct in that we should be taking that into account as well.
Rob, you have probably already read these comments from Linda regarding the Payoff Calculator. I know you were already working with Kelly on a few of these issues and were writing additional stories for them. When you write your additional stories you will want to make sure you are addressing Lindas comments in your enhancement stories so we dont need to write more stories later. It would also be a good idea if you take a look at the spreadsheets that Linda is referencing while writing the enhancement stories for the Payoff calculator as well if you already havent done so. That way we know we have all the angles covered.
Please let Linda or I know if you need help deciphering the spreadsheets.
Thanks,
Matt
Matt,
Thank you very much for providing the information that was contained in the Roseville Application. Upon review of the document my findings are:
The calculation is only applicable to FFP account and does not take into consideration the years where there is a leap year of 366 days.
The calculation is not for Traditional Account types where we could have actuarial calculations or rule of 78ths calculations.
The calculation will not function properly for the SmartBuy FFP account types when the balloon payment becomes matured
It was my understanding that the various excel spreadsheets that are used by the various business teams, which was supposed to include the Bankruptcy team were going to be built in SAM to address the situations where we were not able to obtain a payoff quote from CARS.
Beth and/or Theresa, please advise if I should be providing the PSS team with the various Excel spreadsheets  rebate magic, Rebate Calculator, FFP Magic, FinChargsPaid to leverage for this activity.
Thank you. 
Linda

Based on the discussion, below is summary of the suggestions on the Story-04497 (Charge off Letters Report):
1.Keep the report name as Charge off Letters.
2.The value State in the Sum By drop list should be State/ Province.
3.In the summary view of the report, reduce the column width of the column; No. of Letters. This will help the user view the total number of letters without any scroll in the right direction.
4.Change the column header Branch # to Brand. A separate column for Branch # is not required as the first 3 digits in the account number indicate the Branch.
5.Place a column Customer Type before the column Customer Name. The values displayed in this column will be Customer or Co Customer based upon the type of customer.
6.Change the column headers of the following columns:
1.Customer/ Co Customer Name to Name.
2.Customer/ CoCustomerStateto State.
3.Customer/ Co Customer Zip to Zip.
4.Customer/ Co Customer Country to Country.

I starting testing(Web-Ex recording attached) and listed in red are my concerns.

Ariel is preparing and reviewing/modifying selected data fields related to the reaffirmation agreement (form) so it can be sent to customers attorney or pro se debtor.This agreement is sent in order to maintain filers liability to the loan/asset once bankruptcy discharges. Once a filer becomes liable, we can begin normal activity on the account and are no longer obligated to the bankruptcy laws and may lower our risk of a loss.

Preamble: (What steps have already been taken before starting this story?)

a.The first level (summary level) of the report is showing inconsistent formatting between the two samples provided. E.g. Brand the column named No. of Letters Generated is right justified and the Branch Number report at the first level is left justified. Please make all of them left justified.

b.Is the column sizing based upon fit to window parameters or can the columns be made smaller?


c.Please rename the column header from No. of Letters Generated to Count of Letters Generated

d.At the drill down level (detail level), the Branch # rather than the Brand in the 12thcolumn.


e.Is there a way on the detail level to expand the columns?

We Accept Jana's comments
This is not a change in the solution (at least it shouldn't be), just good practice for documentation.

The merge function occurs in two ways. Either systematically based on some conditions, or manually as an action done by the SuperAdmin. The doc doesn't exclude one or the other, but it doesn't recognize either. I just need to be sure that the merge date enhancement will be applied regardless of how the merge happened.

Jeanne & Dawn,As per our discussion,1. We are going to have expand and contract links for the workbaskets similar to worklist as per the story.2. If we do so when the workbasket is expanded the column headers are not frozen and it is fine (currently happening for worklists).3. And also when a user picks up a work item from either workbasket or worklist works and submits it the user will be taken back to the respective workbasket/worklist view in expand mode.Please let me know if i missed out anything here.Thanks.

S-05115 -Paid in Full Electronic Title Account Search Generic

1. The total of the unpaid charges, unpaid late charges and / or unpaid extension fee of <=$1.00, then we need to show Electronic title, Lien
 Satisfaction, Electronic Title Dealer/Third Party Options to User, Also in Case of PaidInfull Thank you letter the condition is total of the unpaid
 charges, unpaid late charges and / or unpaid extension fee = $0.00, We need to show this option.

Therefore, as per the above conditions which means that if it is $0.00 we need to show all 4 Options to User, Is the Understanding correct.

lsz response:All of the Paid In Full Electronic Title and Lien Release should reflect OSB <=$0.00 and total unpaid charges, unpaid late charges and / or unpaid extension fee of <=$1.00, then the letter qualifies for generation.I apologize if the values are not consistent across the stories.
Please clarify what you are referring to as all 4 Options

2. When referring Registration State ( which is eitherContractStateor customer mailing state), understanding is that ifContractStateis available thenwe will take that first, if not available then we need to refer to customer mailing state,Is the understanding correct.

lsz response:This is correct, however there must be a method available for the user to override the mailing state information, as CARS does not pass the registration state information to SAM for the lien release or the electronic title.Also, do not forget that the GAP, Credit Insurance is based upon the contract state.
3. In the Story, we are referring that , When account is searched & has Title code 12, 13 & 14and/or contract state/customer mailing state is AZ, CA, ID, MA, SC, VA,FL, HI or NY..... ,
Can you explain the Title Code values here ?
lsz response:Title codes are values that are supposed to be passed from CARS to SAM.They will be leveraged for identifying when the Electronic Title will be available, however the user must be able to select between Electronic Title and Lien Satisfaction even with the Title codes in place, as not all of the parameters to identify qualification between electronic title and lien satisfaction are currently available.

Here when we are referring to the editable fields as Dealer Name, Address, city , state & zip, Is this correct?
lsz response:This is correct, the dealer information must be editable fields as well.

Subject:RE: Issue for SAM Program Log
Jan,

I really appreciate you using this issue log to document program items. It enables a program level discussion on these items. We should not prevent Canadian accounts from being set up anywhere in SAM. There is Canadian functionality in SAM (both Account Servicing and MI) and this needs to continue to exist. It sounds like there are two issues here:

First, there may be a bankruptcy project issue where Canadian bankruptcy accounts are not appropriate for theUSfunctionality were building and the users are asking that that be systematically enforced. If that was not originally in scope, but is key business functionality, then we need to use the agile methodology to change scope (understanding that we cannot add this to scope and meet our dates without removing equivalent scope in other places).

The second is that there are security enhancements that should have been deployed as part of COD which were removed from scope. One of those items was to prevent US users from creating SRs on Canadian accounts and visa versa, while allowing a read only view into each others country. This is on the backlog for inclusion as some future point in SAM.


Thanks,
Beth

Discussed this defect on 7/22 call. Offshore was not able to recreate this issue. When user logs in and minimizes "My Work in Progress" area, it will stay minimized the next time you log in. If it is expanded and log out it will be expanded when the user logs back in. Based on this conversation, Dawn said we could close this defect and she would handle this situation through training.
NOTE: This behavior is already present in production today, so it is not something introduced with COD 2.

1)I added a note to the story details indicating that the date validation will not happen until the allowances table story is developed, and that this functionality would be tested at that time.
2)You said that when adding an attachment, the category selection was not showing up. I just ran a case through, and the category selection showed up just fine, so it must have been fixed.

Please let me know if there are any other issues preventing signoff on this story.

Thanks.

I might be nitpicking here, but can it read with the space in between the two words: MISCELLANEOUS DOCS? The same for the other categories if they are not already showing up like that?

Return Addresses, like phone numbers should be table driven, for quick and easy changes.
The rules to define which return address to use need to be defined on a letter by letter basis.
The return addresses will be listed on the master spreadsheet that Linda has created.
For PPC return addresses, we should leverage what is already built.
2 different types of return addresses are on the letter:
1.(brand) return address in top left corner of theletter.
2.Remittance address  where info (payments) get sent back to
Solution needs to be flexible enough to identify countries and make changes quickly
A change control process to make edits to letter information (return addresses, phone numbers, etc) will need to be developed.Will this process be in Pega?If so, maybe a control panel will need to be created to update any changes.However, if Pega were to get systematic feeds on a regular basis, the updates would come automatically instead of manually.TOG needs to have a technical spike with architects to see what the best solution would be.

The requirements are stated that the LI DI field is populated with a dollar figure the account will qualify. There are a number of fields that would be taken into consideration for the qualification of LI and/or DI.

The Original Amount and Indicator fields are populated if the customer purchased the warranty at contract signing. There are instances, during the life of the contract where the fields and indicators are updated, therefore,if the account indexed only contains the LI or DI original information, then the applicablefields should be used. If there is a value that is reflected as Current that is different than the original amount, then those fields should be leveraged, as something happened during the life of the contract that adjusted the value.

Please note that we discussed this at length regarding how the Amount Still Due letters will function. I had indicated during that conversation, that it may be easier for the team to create the letters for Amount Still Due and another set of letters for Refund Amount. Since there continues to be some confusion between which letter content is presented following issome additional detail. Please email me or we can leverage a meeting to go over the requirements, if there continues to be questions regarding these letters.

The amount still do letter will pull in the information from the account where if there is a rebate or refund from the payoff quote screen, which results in total amount which is a negative value on the letter  the content of the letter changes from amount still due to refund amount.

If the total amount reflected for the letter is a positive value, the amount still due verbiage is leveraged.

The story that this discussion point is associated wiht is Paid In Full Electronic Title Account Search Generic. As outlined in this story, the qualifications do include the title code.

If the story was regarding the lien satisfaction letters, the title codes listed for electronic title would be excluded as letters that qualify.

However, with that said, the title code is not the only field that needs to be applied to make the Electronic Title or Lien Satisfaction letters qualify. It is a combination of the Registration State and Title code that determines which release letter is generated be it Electronic Title or Lien Satisfaction.

1>I will provide a comment box for Stewie when Reaff is rejected. This will be eventually stored in comments (notes) whenever we are ready.
 2> Question - Should Ariel be able to see this comment on her screen when it is routed back to her? This will be changing once we have comments/notes story in place.
 I was thinking as of now she can see the comment (by Stewie) in the clipboard. Let me know if this is acceptable.

I agree. I tested the approval and that works. However, when I test the rejection, I (Ariel) can not tell why it was rejected. I am fine with seeing a stub on Stewies side that would say something along the line notes would go here and on Ariels side Stewies notes for rejection.

With that said, please leverage the fax number provided until I am able to obtain an updated requirement for the brands. Also, please ensure that the fragment for the fax is quicly updateable so when the information is obtained, there isn't a major change involved in making the updates.

There is no sample other than what is provided in the letters for the image depicting the routing and account numbers. Please leverage that information, ensuring that the US images is taken from the US letter samples and the Canadian image is taken from the Canadian letter samples.

These are symbols / images rather than font. Please use a bullet point that reflects numbers using the Times New Roman font, if possible.

Hi Linda,
Thanks forconfriming this. We will follow the Times New Roman font on the forms. DirectPay forms use size 11 font. However we see an issue in using size 11 on the LienSat forms as they look out of proportion and do not fit into columns accurately because they are too big. They are currently built as appears in the samples. Please confirm if we can retain this. Thank You.

List of user who have access to the letter
The list of user access will be updated, but at this time include: HRC, CSC, EO

In the fields mentioned do you want any validations for
the Make and Model in Vehicle distribution
Please advise what validations you arelooking for the Make and Model.
The information is passed from CARS to SAM, the validation for the Make is already available in SAM, which should be leveraged
Any specific business rules that need to be applied to this letter
Does the team have the Document Template Visual Basics, reverse engineering, etc? If so, then please review that information and then provide the business rules that you believe apply. We will update you if you are not correct.
Last question - I explained previously that there are Document Generation Framework stories that apply across all of the letters, the team is expected to review those stories. Yes, there should already be existing mapping for the phone numbers identified. The WiPro team should have this information available on the fragment log for validation, which is supposed to be maintained in Teamroom. Please advise if this is not the case.

QuestionClarificationWhere do we give the option to generate letter? Is it under select intent or under select intent-> document gen-> account management?This is not a new approach, so hopefully this type of question is put to rest with the following clarification:
Yes, the process is: Document Generation
Account Management is selected, then the letter is available based upon the account type searched uponCSC Associates ( various locations ) only for resend within good thru dates  What do we incur by good thru datesThe payoff quote that is processed will have a payoff good through date. However, with that said, since the reprint functionality is something that is available for all letters. Please advise what impact this is to the timeline.
Lsz will follow-up with business to confirm this need based upon the existing Document Generation Framework approach that has been established for the letter reprint functionality.Please let us know how to identify the users that needs access to the manual pay off quote letters?The manual payoff quote process is currently completed outside of SAM. There will be a need, if the fields that are necessary to properly populate the letter are not available from CARS, the user will be able to enter the information in the fields.
Once that information is entered in SAM, the fields will be mapped to the letter and available on the wireframe for confirmation.Do we need a validation when a CSC agent can resend it?(through good dates)lsz to follow-up with final decision regarding this.We understand that while a CSC selects the addresse as dealer, the address of customer and co customer(if available) will be displayed also()While anyagent that has access to the letter, not specific to CSC.

The letter generation rules for buyer / co buyer continue to apply, so if the selection is made for this, the solution offered as part of the Lien Release could be leveraged.

If the selection is made that the addressee is the selling dealership, the dealer information is leveraged from the account. Again the Lien Release solution offered could be leveraged.

Make this overall story consistent with the solution established for the Lien Release including the same options.How does one determine whether CARSis able to generate the quote and hence map? Is it based on a value of a certain field , which when nullThe payoff quote information from CARs is mapped in SAM. The team should already have access to the code, as this is in production.

2014-12-20 16:49:47.1020 Content is Same address comparison 

Noted from discusion with Linda.
The document should only generate one letter when there are two recipeints, such that their relationship categories are Buyer-Lessee and CoBuyer-CoLessee. The toLine2 will contain the name of the CoBuyer-CoLessee.
In no other case will the recipients need to be combined into one letter. eg. Buyer-Lessee and Guarantor. In this case it will generate two seperateletters.
If there are 3 or more addressees a letter will be generated for all three.

Agreed.Since it will be too complicated and time consuming to address using other means.Also, whatever the solution, we will need to address the existing SAM letters with the revised methodology

Linda,
When i went through the samples in the attachment sections Except for Letter of No Interest_US English sample.doc the other two samples contains the address of the customer. Do we need to build the US letter without the address?
Please let us know.

2014-12-20 16:49:47.6730 Content is responses to questions on 10/6 

List of user who have access to the letter
The list of user access will be updated, but at this time include: HRC, CSC, EO

In the fields mentioned do you want any validations for
the Make and Model in Vehicle distribution
Please advise what validations you arelooking for the Make and Model.
The information is passed from CARS to SAM, the validation for the Make is already available in SAM, which should be leveraged.
<AJ on 10/07>Validations is requested from the Business and we understand that these validatons should be built by the Frame work team. The question is deferred and out of scope for theis release.
Any specific business rules that need to be applied to this letter
Does the team have the Document Template Visual Basics, reverse engineering, etc? If so, then please review that information and then provide the business rules that you believe apply. We will update you if you are not correct.
Last question - I explained previously that there are Document Generation Framework stories that apply across all of the letters, the team is expected to review those stories. Yes, there should already be existing mapping for the phone numbers identified. The WiPro team should have this information available on the fragment log for validation, which is supposed to be maintained in Teamroom. Please advise if this is not the case.
<AJ on 10/08> We reviewed it with the team and based upon the study of the existing stories,we understand that this logic is already built .We however wanted to make a note that this is been done as a part of R1 and R2 and not a framework story

Do we need to implement the logic to decide the PO Box of the return address based on Branch Number and the user profile. Pega team mentioned that they implemented the user profile and branch numberspecific logic in R1 & R2. Is there any change now?
And also do we need to need to consider the logic that is built based on the language indicator.

Please note that the story is making the list of the sites that will have access not down to the level of the agents. However, when the team is updating the DCU and DCC ids, they must apply the rules for the sites that have been spelled out in the story for access. This will allow us to complete the testing for profiles that have access and those that do not...as well as testing for profiles that are personalized versus generic. This is all part of the Document Generation Framework stories series that are supposed to be incorporated in each letter.

When you look at the story and the letter, please advise if you see anything that is an exception from the existing rules for the control file.

When you indicate "old control file rule", I would like to have more details because there have been a number of bugs introduced with the control file. Based upon this, please provide the rules that the development team understands to be needed for the control file and then I will be able to identify what needs to change.

Akshat,
The menu option ison hold for this release, as it has a dependancy on the development of the menu by the Document Generation Framework team, but the team is supposed to be designing the letter solutions so they work with menu option or via Select Intent, when the information is updated in the story.

There will be a new story written that addresses the menu needs for the letter once we have seen the solution for the Select Intent option.

One has access to the document genration- Two parts- personalised(onsite) and generic( offshore). If its a personalised site and if its not a CSC - then the site specific no is used(if available). If it is generated by someone offshore or a CSC, the CSC phone no would depend on the Brand.Work with Linda to get an example.
Determine if this logic is already built as of today- AI on Wipro (Lien release does not have personalised phone no).

There is a EXT-DUE, UNPD-CHRGS, and CALCULATED_AS_OF field in CARS. Are these fields derived from calculations, and did you want SAM to calculate them? If they are calculated in CARS, then it might be difficult for us to grab the information, so would you know how are these fields calculated?
OR, are you saying that unpaid extension fee + unpaid charges and/or additional charges = X? What does X mean?

Linda,
1.Language Indicator, since we have language indicator which is coming from CARS alreadyfor US English (00), French (01), Spanish (02). Please tell us know the language indicator for Canadian English as mentioned in the story?
Linda's Response :Language Indicator for English is (00). We dont have any specific indicator for US or Canadian English.
2.can you please confirm whether the look of addresses for the letter generation same as "Lien Release" developed as the part of Release-2?
Linda's Response :Apply the same Pega Design solution for this letter.
3.According to the PEGA dev team, currently there are not mappings for the following GMAC Canada Unit in Dev. Do you want us to create the mapping ?
GMAC Canada Unit Work Group
ACS Image Vendor
ICT Customer Service Centers - CSC
Linda's Response :Leverage the existing profile from SIT.
4.As per the "No Interest" letter, the salutation will show "Dear <attentionName>" if the attention Name is given in the wireframe, if the attentionName is blank then it should display "To Whom It May Concern".
Is the same salutation logic applicable for French and Canadian english variations?

If so, wedo nothave a French or Candian Englishsample without attentionName, hence we requirean exact replacement sentence for "To Whomever it may concern" in french.

Linda's Response :Leverage the existing stories that address the specific section from the Doc Gen Framework stories.

5.Can you please provide us the Web URL for Canada Brands ( Subaru & Consilium)

Linda's Response : use the email address in the letter. use consistence approach.



RESMOR : Information will be provided later.
Update from Linda :
Theres only one valid web address:www.subaru.ca

None exists for Consilium and ResMor.
6. Any update on the Spanish Version. Is it going to be part of this Iteration or not?

Linda Response : If it is not obtained by tomorrow develop in later iteration. (iteration yetto be confirmed) Will have an answer by end of day today and decision will be made at that time.

Thanks for providing the Unit +Work group combination. For GMAC - Semperian as per the list there is a Unit called Developer Admin but there is no work group associated with it. When we went through the Unit + Work group combination in SAM we didnt find any work group as "Developer Admin" Please advice on this.
Developer Admin
Linda's Response: No need for it.

Also, We already have unit + workgroup combination's for "Document Generation" Intent implemented in the DF Framework Code, which is not in sync with the list provided for this letter.

But as per the attached samples (all the 4 samples), the corresponding line is missed out. can you please confirm which verbiage should be followed while developing the story

2014-12-20 16:50:09.7660 Content is 13 Oct Category Clarification 

This Letter comes under the "Notification" Category. We already have this category under "Document Generation", which is part of SAM Release 1. This category already has the letter "Vehicle Return" , which hasnotbeen integrated into the DF Framework.
Firstly, are we refering to the same category?
If yes, It is not feasible as of now to include the "Unable To Contact" letter into this category, as this category isnotpresent in the DF Framework.
If no, then we need a different name for the category, as we cannot have two categories with the same name.
Please advice us on the same.


Linda's Response: If it needs to bring on the Doc Gen please do so. Manoj has to send a email regarding the approach and the impact analysis.

Linda,


1. Please provide us the fields through which we can get payoff quote information and related business rules. Please explain below info
If the CARS application does not provide the quote, the SAM letter must allow the user to manually enter the values that are necessary to properly populate the letter for the payoff quote, where SAM systematically totals the values that are entered in each of the fields.


Need to discuss with Suprit and Conrad for getting the mapping.



2. Please provide us the ACS mailing address because in S-04622 there isnoACS mailing address information. In story Electronic Payments  Incorrect Account Number i.e. 5351 we have been advised that to use ACS address as mentioned in S-04622?

Linda's Response : Refer Mail Room Address for ACS mailing address

Hi Linda,

As mentioned in the earlier call, we will have to first bring the existing "Notification" Category and the letter "Vehicle Return" into the DocGen Framework(which is currently under GMAC-SAM-Work), and then we could go ahead with the development of the letter Unable to Contact.

This would include the development of an extra letter in this iteration, which includes the effort of understanding the exiting functionality of the letter and coding the same under Framework. It does not have any impact on any other functionality as such.

I am estimating around 2.5 days (units) for the CUT phase of "Notification" Category and the letter "Vehicle Return", and another 1.5 days (units) for the letter Unable to Contact.

Manoj.

"Credit Life Insurance, Credit Accident/Health Insurance, Mechanical/Maintenance Service Agreement, GAP Protection, OnStar, XM Satellite Radio, Other.If any product selected then the name of the Company Providing Coverage must be entered.(required, editable field)...." Do you want to have this as a 'list' or a 'dropdown' and how to identify the name of the Company Providing Coverage? Are the above values coming from CARS are we need to populate list/dropdown?

LSZ Response : - Clarification will be provided and the story will be updated.

3.1) THis is something that we need to start thinking while developing the letters because customer demographics information is going to be available for subsequent iterations.
3.2) The indicator to determine obligated parties will be something that is demo'ed' by shawn.There is no change in the document framework for the sake of this story.
3.3) CC- the other parties?-> It was already built as a part of R1 and R2. Understand from R1/R2 team

2. The Notification (Category name), Scheduled End Expired Notification SL9 (Letter name) is generated as a reminder letter to the customer when the final payment Smart Lease payment has matured on a Lease Agreement 9.

Logic : - Is that we have to calculate any date difference for this letter before generating or showing up the letter in dropdown?.
 Final payment date should be compared to current date for the visibility of letter in dropdown (variance select). If the current date is greater than Final payment date then we will show the letter in the select variance. Please confirm the logic.

3.The letter is applicable only for AI accounts or there is any special condition for PI accounts. Please confirm.

We had a discussion with Linda about all business logic we need to consider for the no Interest letter. It just got SIMPLER.

a)For PI accounts: For any account that is pulled out of SAM after PI search, we will show them the option to generate the no interest letter.
b)For AI accounts: Any account pulled out of AI search where only the OSB= 0 can have this letter generated.
c) For AI lease accounts: Any account searched upon using AI, the letter is available. (The solution is not tied to the OSB = $0.00)

for 1) There is no need to generate a cover letter for dealers/suppliers i.e. there is no need to have a CC field in the letter too. It will only be a 1 page letter.
5) the list of unit + work group uploaded above is correct. and we need to build skills for the same to determine access to the letter at the letter level
6) apply the overrirde signature block response:
say :"Remarketing Department" and not just "serv rep".

The only time I will be addressing fulfillment options will be based upon exception management. If the story does not call out exceptions the normal rules for fulfillment options apply:
1) Personalize profile has all of the options (however the Title Vendor fulfillment option is hidden at this time.)
2) Generic profile has only the Print Vendor fulfillment option.
Please make a note of this, so we do not have to cover this question on a letter by letter basis.

QuestionsResponsesHow does an agent know that the account qualifies for extension, we believe that it's an offline process or we need to look at indicators?, please confirm?There is no systematic method currently available in SAM to generate when this letter would qualify and when it would not. Based upon this, the letter will be available for the accounts that are on the AI screen for retail and balloon account types.How does one determine the bankruptcy status and hence thevariation change based on bankruptcy status? -lsz - The decision table requirements outline is in story 5460 in SAM regarding how one would determine if an account is in bankruptcy status or not.Samples are missing. I understand that Jeff may have sent it to you for youre review. But we would need the approved samples by EOD today/tomorrow pls.lsz - As previously indicted, if you have the samples from the Word document, then they are sufficient and I do not have to review them.Liability: Has customers obligation been discharged through bankruptcy?If the 15-18 bankruptcy code is updated to reflect a discharged 15-18 code, SAM will systematically identify and default the response to the Discharged question to yes.If the 15-18 bankruptcy code is not updated then the system must allow the user to select Discharged or Not Discharged.This will be on wireframe, correct?lsz - The system should reflect the option for the user to select yes or no for the discharged bankruptcy and then the proper letter content presented based upon the option selected.There will be no default for this item.

With that said, if the account, based upon the story requirements from 5460, is in an active bankruptcy status, the system should insert the bankruptcy paragraph in the letterWhat is the logic to identify the weekly/fortnightly payments?lsz - At this time there is no logic available in SAM.Number of Days Extended  (Since SAM does not currently have the EQ / EQS or MEQ fields mapped, the various extension quote fields will be user entered, at this time.) when mapping is available the CARS field name is:DAYS-TO-EXTEND: field and populate on the wireframe / letter.(This field must be editable)(This field is editable) .This will always be a user editable, correct?lsz - At this time the field will be editable for the user to enter the number of days extended.1. This letter applies for GMAC, National, Nuvell, and Suzuki brands for US accounts - how about canadian accounts?language variations?lsz - This letter applies to Canada and there are several stories available in Version One that outline this.I am following up with the Canadian SMEs for additional clarification for the story.Any specific requirements for fulfillment options?As previously discussed, the story will only call out exceptions.If there are no exceptions identified the basic design applies.So, based upon this requirement, since the story does not call out any exceptions the requirements are that all fulfillment options are available for the US and Canadian users, the Title Vendor is hidden and the Print Vendor only option is available for the Off Shore or Non GMAC Vendor employees.Based on the earlier conversations, we should not be having the stories no 5432 and no 5433 in scope because they are referring to Smart buy and spanish.Story 5432 Payment Management Extension - SmartBuy/Balloon US Spanish - is not available for build at this time and will be placed in the backlog
Story 5433 Payment Management Extension - SmartBuy / Balloon FFP US Spanish - is not available for build at this time and will be placed in the backlog.

2. The approach for this letter is to pull the name of the associate (from SAM) since as of now only the onsiteagents have access to generate this letterand the phone no that is used is the generic phone nos based on the unit and work group

AJ on 11/9" the story says that the letter should say generic signature but the response above says personal name. Which one is accurate?

The list of units and workgroups is

What is the skill set to be used here pls?

Dev team- Please use the extended ACS/PPC zip codes as applicable. Updates have been made in V1 under 4622 for the same
Also, only the agents with the unit and workgroup combination with the skill set to generate the letter(label will be provided ) can generate the letter.
As with any letter in SAM, US agents can generate letters for accounts that originated in US only and canadian agents can generate for canadian accounts only.

Please take the above for any and every story that we create in doc factory unless exceptions are called out

This letter is for US english only based on the notes in the story.

Extensions is editable

Traditional account- charges for extensions are editable

Late charges due- pre populated with late charges based on the cars mapping and editable

Other charges- unpaid charges, extension fees, -all pre populated and editable like pay off quote but do not include OSB.

The total of all the above would be SubTo-total1

total to be paid up now= sub total1 + charges for extensions

Next regular schedule payment with a $value  pre populated and editable
Due date- next payment due date from sam/cars, - pre populated and editable
APR- editable

7 payments of $800 due->
No of payments- extended -> label for 7(This is coming in SAM)
The no of installments table is mapped into SAM. This is collapsible / dynamic and the content comes from Sam home page

Its either weekly, monthly- mapped in SAM already. We cant 100% rely on indicator so use valid value.(However based on conversation in the afternoon today)

Put a spreadsheet/mock up for the extensions (turn this around today if possible- Akshat)

We dont need separate samples for traditional and FFP for bankruptcy. The content is same if the bankruptcy para needs to be added

If the account is has filed for bankruptcy (with one of the indicators coming back)

Whether or not the customer has been discharged or not? On wireframe yes/no on the wire frame. Show this option only if the Bankrupcty indicator is Yes/No

If discharged is selected on wireframe add,
Because of your bankruptcy, you do not have to pay anything more on this account. However, if you choose not to continue to pay the amounts owed on this account, the vehicle may be taken from you.

If not discharged
To the extent that your obligation is discharged through bankruptcy, you will not have to pay anything more on this account. However, if you choose not to continue to pay the amounts owed on this account, the vehicle may be taken from you

Else
The generic sample
In select variant? - > just one Extensions


Mockto be provided by akshat.

Accounts with an 800 status will offer the user to select In Bankruptcy Yes or No, (Note: preferably this information is captured as part of the wireframe)

If Yes is selected, the bankruptcy letter rules apply and the user must select discharged Yes or No to apply the proper Bankruptcy fragment based upon the selection made.

If No is selected, the bankruptcy letter rules do not apply and the user will not be required to make the selection discharged Yes or No, this option will not be visible on the wireframe, nor will the Bankruptcy fragment be inserted into the letter.

House no- user entered and not pre-populated
Main Street-user entered and not pre-populated
City-user entered and not pre-populated
State- user entered and not pre-populated
Zip code- should be 5 digit but allow 4 more fields for extension.

The existing harness/UI section for address field inCanadacan be reused for this section. All the entries will be user editable and selected through a LOV


Fulfillment options- the only options available are FAX and local print, and hold in my queue

license plate is mapped in SAM(for lease account types)- It is not a mandatory field but editable (get the mapping and get it verified)

Team,On the approach that we are supposed to take on iteration2 - pay off quote retail- canada letter for canadian english and french variations is as follows:1) Pay off quote- Canada- retail- EnglishPega team- Please add the following 3 fields on the wire frame for Canadian accounts which is being addresses to Dealer. If it is not a Canadian account and if it is not address to dealer, then it should not show up on the wireframe at alla) Faxed to: Name  (to be entered by the user)b)FAXNumber - (to be entered by the user)c)Remaining Term:numberof payments remaining on the account from Home screen and tabs
d)Scheduled Payments: the scheduled payment amount mapped from the Home page of the Payments Remaining:
e)Pre-Authorized Payment Plan: Mapped from HS&Ts Billing and Banking Info Billing Status

I would suggest that we have a different place holder for these 5 elements under the pay off quote area. It should be dynamic and as seperate from the pay off quote because it is not logically connected to the pay off quote calculations.

The three additional information will not be populated on the letter but will be captured only on the wireframe one way to have the extra 3 elements for dealer( the three elements are visible based on country and for the letter type i.e. dealer). These 3 data elements will not be on the letter and we will apply consistent look on this letter like the US english.Using that approach,to be able to build the Canadian French letters, we are looking for the translated(in French) versions of the samples of pay off quoteattachedhere.b)Extensions Canada- Weare applying the sameapproach for Canadian English for Extensions. Itneeds to be exactly as the US english. We also need to use the generic version (US) of Retail Traditional and Retail FFP. We understand that there are no SmartBuy (Traditional and FFP) account typesfor Canada andtherefore itis not applicable for Canada. With that, we would like to request you to provide French translatted version of the samples attached here for extensions retail

TeamResponses to our questions on shortage due.. let me know what else is missing.. the same has been updated in v1 under 5463. The same is applicable for the spanish variation of this letter.In story its written like Paid-In-Full and/or Payment Resolution users need to be able to access this letters. So my question is do we have separate skill set for these letters or there are some another BRs for these letters?-AJ: We will need to have a skill set built calledDOC_US_PaidInFull_Shortagedue. The associate should have the skill set in addition to the unit and workgroup combination.2)Please provide unit & work group combinations for these letters?-knoxville admin and sitel admin() in addition in addition to the existing PIF associates
 AJ:
SiTel (Mumbai & Hyderabad)Paid In Full Associates (Knoxville)CSC Employees (All over the place) Only for resend, exception creation. Basically all the units locations where we have the CSC workgroupBankruptcy Team- RosevilleExecutive Office




in addition to the unit and workgroup they should have the skill set mentioned above3)In story contradictory statements are there which are:

a)The user will generate the letter to the customer and/or co-buyer only- we have retired the dealer one
b)The shortage Due letter is addressed to either the Dealer or the customer, with content of letter adjustments made based upon the addressee selected at letter generation.
Please confirm the number of addresses and specify them. As both the statements are confusing in terms of no. of addresses.->AJ:no dealer variation required.
4)Should we wait for framework changes as intermediate screen is required for address selection?-AJ:I am not sure about that. Let's discuss on whatisa show stopper from a framework perspective
Need mocks up: AJ:net amount and good through date-> retail and retail ffp for smartbuy/ballon(trad/ffp)->Retain the exact same UI built for pay off quote for this letter. Just map Net amount and good through date on the letter.

"To the extent that your obligation is discharged through bankruptcy, you will not have to pay anything more on this account. However, if you choose not to continue to pay the amounts owed on this account, the vehicle may be taken from you"
Spanish translation:
Cuando su deuda es condonada mediante una quiebra, usted no tendr que pagar nada ms para esta cuenta. Sin embargo, se le podr quitar el vehculo si decide no continuar pagando las sumas adeudadas para esta cuenta.

Currently in Lien Release if registration state is CO, we are using Lien Release generic letter. As per updated requirement, if registration state is CO and letter is addressed to Secretaryof State (or) DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles] then the updated letter is used.
The letter sent to other recipients remains unchanged (generic content).
New recipients (Secretary of State/DMV) would be added to the flow if the state is CO. A new template would be built with provided content:
Notice is given that (Brand Name) hereby notes satisfaction of the lien held by (Brand Name) due to payment and satisfaction of the underlying obligation.(Brand Name) certifies, under penalty of perjury to the second degree, that its signature releases and transfers its interest in the vehicle to the owner, (customer name).
This template is loaded for the combination of state (CO) and recipient (Secretary of State/DMV).

All the business rules followed for Pay off quote retail data elements will remain the same. Only 2 fields from the screen shot attached will be on/mapped tothe letter.
a) Good through date
b) Net amount
These fields are calculated exactly the same way as they are calculated for pay off quote -retail. The only difference is that only 2 fields are mapped on the letter. If a field is mapped/editable/user entered etc in pay off quote, it will remain exactly the same as that for shortage due. THe wireframe does not change except the section header which instead of saying Pay off quote details , it will say "Shortage due details".
However, the "fax no" and "fax to" fields which are currently applicable only for Canadian English- Dealer variation(not customer variation) will be dropped for shortage due wireframe. Also, based on comment from Linda, it is recommended that we drop these 2 fields from wireframe for both pay off and shortage due. This update is because we have Fax To and FAX# as a part of the fulfillment options already.

This letter is generated only for retail account based on Document template tool. Linda- Please let us know if this is not correct

1.Please let us know, which of the above 2 screens will we be implementing in shortage due story, or, is the case that we are implementing both of the screens in the shortage due and differentiating it based upon the acc type. If we are considering the screen as per the acc type, then please also let us know, which screen has to be leveraged for acc types other than Smartbuy and Std retail (these are the only 2 types available for payoff quote).
lsz  The choice does not apply, as the letters would require the same fields that are applied to the Payoff Quote letters, but the mapping on the letter is based upon the Net Amount and the Good Through date. The rest of the fields are applied using the account type, etc that was built for the Payoff Quote Letters.
Beth and Bev  Please advise if you agree or disagree with this approach. If you disagree, then provide the business requirements that should be applied.<Conformation pending from business SMEs>
2.We have some fields which will be visible for Canadian accounts only. So we are assuming that we will not show these fields in shortage due letter. Please confirm. For reference we have marked the fields on above screens which will come for Canadian accounts only.
lsz  This letter is not available for the Canadian users at this time, due to no story being received

to todetail out further here,

a) The workflow for shortage due for a retail traditional account is exactly the same as the one for pay off quote retail traditional. All the screen layout/data elements/business rules are exactly same as pay off quote. The only difference is that only2 fields, Net amount(as calculated for payoffquote retail traditional) andgood through date((as calculated for payoffquote retail traditional) is mapped on the letter.

b) The workflow for shortage due for a retailFFP account is exactly the same as the one for pay off quote for retail FFP.All the screen layout/data elements/business rules are exactly same as pay off quote. The only difference is that only2 fields, Net amount(as calculated for payoffquote retail FFP) andgood through date((as calculated for payoffquote retail FFP) is mapped on the letter.

c) The workflow for shortage due for a Balloon traditional account is exactly the same as the one for pay off quote balloon traditional. All the screen layout/data elements/business rules are exactly same as pay off quote. The only difference is that only2 fields, Net amount(as calculated for payoffquote balloon traditional) and good through date((as calculated for payoffquote balloon traditional) is mapped on the letter.

d) The workflow for shortage due for a BalloonFFP account is exactly the same as the one for pay off quote for balloon FFP.All the screen layout/data elements/business rules are exactly same as pay off quote. The only difference is that only2 fields, Net amount(as calculated for payoffquote balloon FFP) andgood through date((as calculated for payoffquote balloon FFP) is mapped on the letter.

With the following exceptions,
a) There is no dealer varationa
b) Since there is no story in v1, obviously, there is no canada variation and obviously the data elements specific to canada pay off quotewill be no where on the screen.
c) Unit and workgroup combinations have not yet been confirmed by SMEs.this was confirmed on 20 nov

Business rule for an account to qualify for this letter: on 20 th nov
Only for account that has OSB>0 with the required skills , account type and unit and workgroup (provided in v1)
The skill name has been provided. The unit and work group information is in V1 and confirmed. The rule for account qualification in addition to the above is that it should be eithera Retail/Balloon(both traditional/ffp) account and osb>0

the above unit and workgroup has access to canada - extensions letter-
The canadian extension letter is built only for English and french is totally out of scope.
Please consider the following inputs:
a) Canadian French stories are completely out of Scope.b) For the Canadian English- we have to use the exact same logic as US english. However the following things will change1) The unit and work group combination for Canada is different from that of US2) The skill set name would be different3) On the Canadian side, this letter will not be generated for both Smartbuy/Balloon FFP and Traditional. It is applicable for Retail only(Trad and FFP). Let me confirm this and update in v1. This basically means the wireframe and letter with nostate specific requirements/variants will depend on the account type as generated for Retail Trad and FFP.4) Only English will be the option for languages5) Control file contents, returen address, logos,PPC address, tel nos etc will be different and will use Canadian stories6) We need to use only the generic version of the extension letters as the there is no specific state requriements in Canada. It will obviously have both Bankruptcy and non bankruptcy variants of generic letters.

We should have VIN and account no editable? Atleast VIN should be editable since account no does not come up in the letter. We will have to take the approach similar to Lein release here.
VIN is not editable in lein release and make/model is.
Buyer/Co buyer logic: for PIF/Lein release, we are sending 1 copy if buyer and co buyer are at the same address else there will be 2 copies will be sent one for buyer and other for co buyer

2014-12-20 16:51:38.7790 Content is Completion notes 

The bug was in the logic surrounding the building of the tree. The "id" of each node on the tree used to be the name of the node (the one visable to the user). If you had 2 nodes with the same name when the user clicked on either one the system would find only the first one and expand/contact that. This was true even across the Rule and Exceptions Domain. If you expaned a node on the Exceptions domain it might appear to do nothing but when you switched back to the Rules Domain it would show that trees node as expanded/contacted.

I updated the HTML (DSEDomExpGroup, DSEDomExpGroupExceptions, DSEDomExpInner and DSEDomExpInnerExceptions) to use an ID that takes the name, a 'counter" and a rule/exp flag to ensure it is always unique.

It appears that the ConfigData record called DomainClass forRFGUSMort-Service-PMwas accidently changed on 23-Mar. I updated it to contain the classes that appear to be correct based on the DomainProperty configdata record. The explorer now shows multiple nodes of data. Warning: I made the class list based on an educated guess by looking at the classes in Class Explorer. Someone needs to go in and make sure that list is correct. From an RMF perspective the toolit appears to be working (now - after the other bug fixes).

Also please confirm acc. to yesterdays discussion

Lsz I asked Akshat to pull the historical information that WiPro had from the Shaw/SAM Release 2 as well as reaching out to the Shaw team.

Puerto Rico Past Due Letter of Intent
1.The category name has been changed to Asset Management from Performance. Please confirm the same.
Lsz  this change was communicated several days ago. Is there are reason that there is a need for reconfirmation when the story contains the updates?
2.Is the letter name  Letter of Intent, Puerto Rico Past Due Letter of Intent or 2 Day Letter of Intent
lsz  Please provide the sample of the Puerto Rico Past Due Letter of Intent.
Please note that when I sent the email including the story, the sample of the letter named: DOC-17263_PR 2 Day Letter of Intent.pdf was included. Based upon this, it is safe for the team to assume that the letter name Letter of Intent will be associated with the letter formally known as 2 Day Letter of Intent
3.We do not have the FISI number for ALLY brand. I understand that this letter is also applicable for ALLY.
lsz - Jeff or Duane can probably provide the decision that was made regarding the FISI for Ally as they have been involved with more rebranding meetings than I. If not, I will follow-up with the Corporate Rebranding lead to determine if my understanding is accurate regarding the GMAC FISI 00.

In the interim, please confirm since as part of the rebranding, SAM is moving to the new BIN, which I believe includes the break down identified to be used, why would this confirmation be necessary.
4.It would be nice if we could have the list of properties to be present on the wireframe.
lsz  What properties are you asking for that has not already been provided from either a document generation framework perspective or the story regarding the delinquency information that would be needed?
Puerto Rico Past Due
1.Is the letter name  Past Due Notice or Puerto Rico Past Due Notice .
lsz  Since SAM has the logic to only present the letter when the account searched upon is branch 599, there is no need to include in the name of the letter Puerto Rico. The story includes the name of the letter as Past Due Notice.

In all the letters, WorkGroup + unit combination is mentioned as below.
CSCs, Remarketing, HRCs, EO, Repossessions, Bankruptcy and EO
Lsz - Please access the roles and skills matrix which will provide you with the combinations required or ask Tilak or Akshat for assistance regarding the approach for identification.

Read-Only Layers: By default Joe only has access to a layer in a read-only mode. The list of layers Joe can see is still governed by the Work Pools list in their access group. In order for Joe to have the ability to modify a layer they need to have a Skill set in their Data-Admin-Operator-ID. In order to set this up, do the following:1.Add a Rule-Admin-Skill rule with the name Modify-[workpool name]. (e.g. Modify-DevUSMort-Service-Eval-Small). The skill range is not used so just set it at 1 and 1. Make sure the ruleset for the skill is in synch with the ruleset for rules going into that class so everything will move together correctly.Update the Data-Admin-Operator-Id record for your Joe. Go to the Work Access tab and add the skill.The changes to Joe will only take effect after his next login.

You can update his operator profile (data-admin-operator-id) to add / remove the Work "skill" as detailed in the task. Remember that any changes will only take effect after joe logs in/out.

In the record the Config Name should be "ExceptionsValid" (as an aside...why is this repeated?) and the Config Value as "true".

Peer nodes on explorers: RMF will now display the "peer layers" on the rules explorer subject to the following rules: 1) A peer is determined by Named, not directed inheritance. The system will take the current layer, get it's named parent and then get that classes children. 2) The list of "peers" will be filtered by those you have access to review. For example, DevUSMort-Service-Eval-Big has a named parent of DevUSMort-Service-Eval. The parents children are -Big, -Medium and -Small. If your current list of valid layers does not contain -Medium then you will not see it in the rules explorer tree. 3) The currently selected layer is always listed as the first node in the tree.

CSCs, Remarketing, HRCs, EO, Repossessions, Bankruptcy and EO
Lsz - Please access the roles and skills matrix which will provide you with the combinations required or ask Tilak or Akshat for assistance regarding the approach for identification.

The last paragraph of the Incorrect Account Number says "Thank you, and if you have any questions please call the phone number mentioned below.", but as per the new Ally styleguide Signature block, the signature will not show up the phone number. Do we need to have an alternate text in the body of the letter or should we use the Generic signature block? Please clarify.

2014-12-20 16:51:59.5010 Content is Meeting Results and Direction 

we talked about storing each value from the MOP history in a value list, and Mike R. suggested a page list, since there will probably be data accompanying the actual value. Mike was concerned about performance, Greg Parks is just concerned about complexity, and with further thought, we realized that maybe we don't need to store the whole array.

A possible direction, which seems likely now, is that some operation parse the MOP history once and store the resulting (summarized) data in a format the kim can use without further recourse to the history itself.

For example (and this is a simple one, but illustrative): the MOP history "1111133211111 "
(note that spaces represent "unknown")
we would storesomething likethis:
* Current, 1 month ago,5 months running
* 60 days late,6 months ago,2 consecutive months
* 30 days late,8 months ago, 1 month
* Current, 9 months ago, 5 consecutive months
* Unknown, 14 months ago, 3 months running...

then other summarization could happen from there
we could provide kim with the following (we need to determine the complete list of data that is interesting)
number of 30 days lates (per tradeline and total per credit report and overall sum)
number of 60, 90, 120, lates etc.
number of <N> lates in the last two years
number of mortgage lates (last 2yrs and total)
most recent/months since any late(s)
months since repossesion, foreclosure
same info for collection or charge-off

Why does the control file only contain 14 characters not the 20? - Linda Zylstra.

Per Email from Senthil @ Wed 3/24/2010 5:52 PM
Hi Linda,
Regarding the 20 characters BIN.
Currently we are receiving the BIN as displayed below which is 14 characters long(including the white spaces) from CARS which is supposed to be 20 characters long. This is the same which is getting printed in the Control file.
Ivan  Could you please confirm/clarify the same?

In the Word templates, the COS is always(? usually?) included as the second page, the first page being one or another Proof of Claim or a Withdrawal Pleading or what have you. Will themainstories for those documents indicate that a COS should be generated? That additional schedules should or must be included? (These are also usually part of the second page.)
This is especially important for the wireframes, which will have to capture some additional information not restricted to the main document, but especially for thetests, as it is likely to be the case that whoever tests these will not have been in on the JAD sessions.

The 'Other Account Attributes' section says: 'This cover letter will be used where the addressee is ProSe or Debtor Attorney, where documents are generated for theClerk Courtor Trustee and the Clerk or Trustee Cover letter is applied.
Does this mean that generating one document (a form, say), will somehow trigger the generation of several? Clerk Cover + Generic Cover + Form + Certificate of Service (if applicable) + schedule(s) (if applicable)? If yes, please call it out in the story for theForm, and include it in detail in the tests. Does the order of printing matter?

2014-12-20 16:52:24.7630 Content is Addressee for Pro Se letter. 

Please check or confirm whether the Pro Se selection actually (and correctly) substitutes Filing Party 1 data for the Attorney data (andnotFiling Party 2). The section says: 'ProSe which represents Filing Party 1 and/or 2 Addressee or Debtor Attorney.' If it is substituted, will the same name appear under typeCategories Attorney andFiling Party 1?

I assume that the titles should be exact, but the ones in the list don't match what we have exactly in at least some cases. These range from relatively trivial ("Motion for Approval of Reaffirmation Agreement" instead of "Motion to Approve Reaffirmation Agreement") to the curious ("Withdrawal of Proof of Claim"). Are we asking the court to withdraw a withdrawal? I have questions like that on several of the entries in the list.

2014-12-20 16:52:35.5870 Content is Story 6015 & 6044 Business Requirements / Questions 

Following are the additionalbusiness requirements / questions that were triggered as a result of the approach for Profile Management being moved to the business:
Business Response to recommendation story 6044:

1.We want to control the access for the functionality to a very limited group based upon something similar to how the ARWeb system is managed, which currently has two administrators per site.SAM would have to adhere to these types of restrictions for additions and deletions.

User edits could be made available for a broader group but it still must be limited to someone such as the Administrator role at each site.
1.Will this require a new role?Administrator or Super Administrator accesses as they exist today may have limitations.E.g. MI SA does not have skills
2.No matter the solution offered the management surrounding granting permissions to this role will be limited to SAM_Team and/or Sustain with approval from representation from the SAM_Team
3.Vendor access may not be available to be managed by a site representative (e.g. VanWagenon cannot make updates in our system due to limitations established by IT standards and security standards.)
4.Exchange currently contains GMAC sponsorship for any vendor.We may want to mirror that type of activity in SAM.
5.Currently SAM Profile management is based upon WorkGroups that are similar to Site Management.EGRoseville,DallasHRC, VanWagenon, Sitel, etc.Based upon this, there may be a need in this process for SAM were some of the authorizers may require access across sites, while others may be limited to a specific site.E.g. EO authorizers for allUSsites, whileRosevillewould be limited toRosevilleaccesses.Can this type of management be made available?
2.Identify what profile changes will be managed by sustain versus the business.E.g. Will mass and/or release updates continue to be managed by the sustain team?
3.Step by step instructions will be necessary including screen shots before this story can be signed off and or testing conducted or a very enhanced solution document containing all of the information may be acceptable.Following are some of the areas that the direction should include:
1.Requirement to add: Users should not be able to add or update a user with an invalid Unit/Workgroup/Role combination for all, not just Account Servicing
2.Requirement to add: Provide helpful messaging (when trying to set up an invalid combination, when trying to delete a user with items in their work list, when trying to add a user who does not have a valid/current Exchange ID, etc).
3.Requirements for deletions:Identify any limitations / updates that must be made to delete a profile.
e.g. Work list has open items listed.
4.Requirements for Edits  will there be limitations to the edits?Will there be required fields?If there is a sponsor for Vendors, etc requirements how will we identify who the sponsor is?
5.What about assigning skills and workbasket access that we are not able to do in Account Servicing without creating a ticket? This is not addressed below but if we are going to build a portal for adds/deletes/updates maybe it should also be included in the add and update section
4.Current technical challenges that we have observed regarding profile management as it exits today:
1.There were some technical challenges in MI with creating messages to identify that items exist in a users work list if anyone tried to delete the ID. This was raised before we deployed last year as a potential issue considering work items disappear into black hole if user id deleted.
2.Work list has open items listed.
3.Currently there are no notifications or reports in place for workbasket or worklists to ensure that business functionality is not impacted should a user be remove

In your matrix I do not see these listed however they are in the story. Can you confirm these?
Cancellation of Adds
POC Admin Claim

The only other documents I found that we currently have that require this logic are:Tilak, can you double check.
Clerk Cover (Stand-alone)
Reaff Rescission
Withdrawal of Pleading

Do the Filing Parties liability factor into this matrix at all?
In the matrix you list Buyer and Co-Buyer. I assume these are the Filing Parties not the customer demographics parties?

Subject:Brand Name / Legal Name and ECF Updates?

Hello Linda and Rob,
I wanted to follow up on the updates for the Brand Name vs Legal Name and ECF requirements.

Rob  Yesterday you mentioned being able to provide that info by this morning. Is this something you can still get to us today?

Linda  I know you provided the story id (4620) for the Legal Name vs Brand Name requirement. We reviewed the story in V1 but the team provided feedback that the rules in this story do not match the rebrand change.

This allows us to ensure we are developing the right requirements per your needsJ.

There needed to be a new property created for this. I created a .ValuationSource property. This has a declarative expression attached to it. This expression is the value of .Valuations(.IndexValuationSource)
.IndexValuationSource has a value of the smallest index of .Valuations().Base where .Use is true.
Should I use something else to figure out the index of the valuation that I want to use for this property? I need to figure out WHICH valuation I want to use for the new .ValuationSource property.

2014-12-20 16:54:25.2350 Content is Original story text 

Below is the original story test which I am copying here for completeness. The actual work is described in the Unit test and the revised story text.

********************************************************************************************
Currently, excecute rules by category will find all of the rules in the specified category along with rules tagged with any sub category. This has worked well for simple decisions, but Tom the product manager will need more flexibility in how rules are executed. This is of value to Tom because more complicated decisions may be handled by the system.

Need the documentation from the meeting on 3/24 where this was discussed. Did Terry writeup these notes?

Some topics for discussion:
When rules for a topic need to run in a specific order, is it appropriate to create sub categories and sub sub categories strictly to support runtime ordering?
Or
Do we have a custom flow in each Program to support the reordering of categories at runtime?
Or
Do we have a rule in the Program that calls the rules it needs from within when order is important?
Also, the properties that each Program uses to make Grading decisions is different and therefore may drive out more subcategories that or only appropriate for that specific program. That would drive a need to have a custom flow for each program to support the calling of program specific categories.
Also, if we create sub categories and sub sub categories, do we want to change RMF to support Run Rules By Category controlling whether to run only the rules in the category specified or run all rules in the child categories also and in what order??

After researching the details of the system we have discovered that we have a number of issues regarding "NoOp" rules that must be, at least initially, resolved by the underlying PRPC code.

As a result, we will add a story totemporarily remove the ability for the system to create a NoOp rule. Also, a new story will be added to get a bug described and entered into pega support. . We will move this story tothe Future when we canonce again enable NoOp processing.

is was decided that:

1) We will not use the "call(xxx)" notation as described in the story description.
2) We will enhance the system to prevent have the initial Decision Tree set to not allow the calling of other trees/tables or maps via the "build in" dropdowns on the tree rule form.
3) We will support the notation of calling "like rules" (i.e. trees calling trees, maps calling maps and tables calling tables) using the return value of "Call NameOfRule".
4) We write a message to the team informing them of this direction and discourage them from changing the tree settings to allow them to reenable the dropdowns.

we decided the following:

1) We do not want expressions calling tables, trees or maps because a) You cannot get an "exceptioned" version of them and b) you cannot control how many times they will fire (and in turn emit messages).
2) We will write an email informing them the team of this.

Should display Address Info and Vehicle description?
20110104:lsz - should what display the address information and the vehicle description?
The cover letter or the Power of Attorney?Yes the cover letter would follow the reference formatting requirements for a cover letter, which includes the Account Number, Customer Name, VIN and Year, Make and Model
The Power of Attorney?No, the power of attorney form would not apply the reference formatting requirements that includes the account number, customer name, VIN and year, make and model.The values that exist on the letter would be populated.

Should we follow the standard font face and size (Arial, 10pt)?Yes.See the updated sample to be used as a guide

Does this document requires a cover letter?Yes, if the document is sent through the print vendor.If local print, the cover letter could be optional based upon user selection.I believe I called this out in one of the stories containing the updates for this document.

In the Title Owner Section, an additional requirement of Tax IDs is mentioned in the story but missing in sample, please provide the sample includes Tax details.Story Description:
In addition to that, there will be a place holder for 3 tax ids- manual entry(these will appear on the letter only when values are entered(dynamic rows)):
The labeldescription and the value will be added:
Label 1 Value1
Label 2 Value2
Label 3 Value3
Sample attached.The requirement will be that the fields are available on the wireframe and if populated will be displayed on the letter.

Provided an updated version of the Spanish letter.Please use the English sample provided.
3.Should we follow consistent rules to align the label and the values available in the samples?

4.Company in the Cover Letter sample is hardcoded as Ally Servicing, Should we map it to company long name?
Yes, please use the brand information, but if the user selects the document from the no account menu, the user will need to select the brand that will be reflected in the disclosure statement.If they do not select anything, the default will be Ally  just like the BIN requirements outline

2014-12-20 16:55:02.1310 Content is Cannot reproduce consistently  (Comment)

Screen utilizes significant client AJAX functionality to show/hide fields and perform data validation in response to user input.
My hypothesis isthese AJAX calls to the server are occuring either in an inconsistent order, or some are not completely properly, such that the browser state and/or clipboard state are inconsistent, and result in this error.
One possible solutionis to simplifythis screen by reducing the onchange data validation, which would in turn reduce the AJAX calls, and minimize the opportunity for this type of problem.

2014-12-20 16:55:17.8960 Content is Pending Fix 

this issue is really two defects:
1. the date validation rules, which have been corrected via a patch was installed in Dev, and still need to be installed to SIT (the problem still occurs in SIT)
2. when a date fails validation, the date format should not be changed to the internal Pega Date format (20110111T000000.000)
I corrected this second issue by changingthe standard Pega DateTime HTML Property rule in unlocked Pega-ProCom:05-05-16. Terry is discussing with Mark and other on how best to handle this.

This report is largely complete but is currently being updated by the business to include Non-Filing Party Data for 3P. As such, the following additional fields are needed which are not currently populated on the report:
Non-Filing Party 1
Non-Filing Party 1 SSN
Non-Filing Party 2
Non-Filing Party 2 SSN
Once these fields are available, we need to create a case with values for each of these, then retest the report to ensure the values are obtained properly.

Execute rule by category will pick up the original rule with the old category and run that as well as the modified rule with the new category. Somehow, someway we may be able to make remove duplicates smart enough to sense this situation and not run the original rule. This is fraut with danger. For now, do not allow Joe to change a category. Must either delete or block the rule. This is a design flaw that weshould address in a future release.

The story had it italicized however, it was not italicized in any of the samples. Since it was already developed without being italicized, I said it would be ok.
How do you want to handle it? I am fine either way.

The story has a defect caused by an unknown variable. The fixed purchase price is stored in two separate places for Ally and Third party accounts. The document is currently mapped to the Ally version of the property. The agreement is that since third party is not currently doing any leasing business, we will approve the story and write an enhancement story to be addressed in the ally release.

Business Review of Splash Page Recommendation Feedback / Questions
a.Discussion regarding the Splash Page  A sample of the original splash page was displayed for the team.A request has been made tomove the different sections around, adding a Whats New section on the top right and moving the Messages section to the center of the page.
b.Following are the questions that will be posed to the Ally Pulse Team:
i.How quickly and who can put information in there?The updates are immediate if the current functionality is available for the Servicing AutoMation page.The who: Linda Zylstra has permissions to make updates, will need to research to determine if another business representative and a technical representative can be included to make updates to specific sections of the page.
ii.There will be a need to communicate to another population of the business that will not necessarily log into SAM.What communication means can be put into place to make SAM updates available for those that are not SAM users?
iii.The business team has a requirement to reduce the number of clicks it takes to access information, because the majority of the end users are timed or measured for thief output/ through put.The presentation as it stands will require the user to click on the SAM link on the Work Tools page and then select Launch SAM on the splash page.Is there a way that the SAM link can auto pop, while at the same time keeping open the interim splash page?
iv.If the splash page is kept open, how will immediate messaging function when updates are made that need to be broadcast across the population?
v.Does this work differently for users that are logged in versus those that are not?
vi.Will there be a means available to manage the Splash page updates based upon user permissions?There is a need to limit information to specific users such as:Vendors, Attorneys, where Ally Servicing Employees or contracted employees will receive more updates/links.

Based upon the initial review, the recommendation for the approach for communication appears that it could meet the business needs if the above requirements are met.

During a conversation regarding the Registration State selection available on the wireframe, there was a concern raised that if the user changes the registration state they will also be changing the "Owner" or "Lienholder" updates even if they over rode the information in the read/write fields.

To address this concern the business request is to have a sentence included on the wireframe whichindicates to the end user that by changing theRegistrationState, they will be changing the Owner and Lienholder to align with the state selected.

The sentence can be"Changing theRegistrationStatealso changes the Owner and Lienholder information as it aligns to theRegistrationState. Please review all of the fields to reflect titling updates."

2014-12-20 16:55:33.6530 Content is Concern Regarding Reg POA - US with Table 

lsz email 03/31/2011
Team,
I spoke to Kathy regarding the requirement about Ally Capital versus Ally Bank versus Ally Bank Corp and determined that there was a misunderstanding of the information that was provided.

The US Registration POA will have reference to Ally Capital for branding based upon the mailing states (HI, MS, MT, NJ, WI), but the lien holder in those states will always be Ally Financial.Based upon this conversation, I believe that if we add a question to the story to provide the State  pull the state into the wireframe for Registration and Mailing based upon the answer made for the Registration POA, then everything will be updated properly.

Ive updated the story with this information and added a new worksheet that includes the State reference.

Based upon this new information, do you want another meeting for clarification of story 6988 or the Registration POA?

Sanjay,

You have my approval as this will not have much of an impact on Canada-Servicing and US mail imaging since we have the comments and attachment sections set to be collapsed by default and this is originally what Jana was looking for.

Sanjay, I dont know if you are aware that Janet is on extended leave and Amy Stark has assumed her role.

Amy, call me if you need me to explain further.

For the CARS / GIF Integration Efficiency discussion, here are some items that we have discussed:
1) ASET project will be making use of the GIF transactions as is. There are no plans to change those at this time.
2) Performancetalks include the following:
a)Look at options around improving GIF tohandle sending multiple requests in one packet, have the GIF iterate to collect all the data, and provide back one response. This is currently not available in GIF and will be discussed as part of the 2012 portfolio talks.
b) Parallel processing within Pega - This is probably not an option for us as the effort to do this would be somewhatsignificant. In addition, GIF has synchronization on the MSMQ queue's sothe effort we make on our sidewould probablybe bottlenecked at the GIF side.
c) Excel spreadsheet import -Since SAM relies on making calls to CARS, it seems that uploading a spreadsheet with CARS data in it doesn't quite make sense. This may introduce additional management of data and synchronization.
d) For DocGen 2011.04, the performance items we would look at include: improvements in the process for multiple documents, any improvements in performance related to GIF server updates/patching, D2D infrastructure migration, as well as performance gains around the Adobe upgrade.

1)  The objective for this import as it relates to the CARS information would be limited to the account number or VIN.  The actions required are not to replace the existing integration with CARS.  It is to address the existing limitations to the CARS initgration.
2)  The additional information that is needed to support the document, which may not be available from the current CARS transactions would be included in the external import.  e.g.  Tax information, the incorrect number included with the payment, U Drive If fees.  These are different examples of information that is not available in CARS but will be needed for the document generation process, where if an import is available, would eliminate manual updates on a letter by letter basis.

2014-12-20 16:55:45.6230 Content is Blocking a rule from an exception 

Mike,

I built a quick test and I don't believe this ever worked. The list of rules in an exception is built in Rule-DSE-Exception.LookupRulesByException which was built in Oct and last edited in Nov by Mark. It appears to have always called "resolve list" on the exceptioned rules, which would have tossed the blocked exception rule before we ever got to the ExecuteRulesByCategory step.

In fact, the comments in the activity indicate that this was the desire - "The consequence of calling resolveList is that any rule that is blocked in an exception will not be found, therefore the base rule will be executed."

Mark - Do you recall why we wanted to resolveList at this point? I am not sure of the reason behind this. Incidentally, this would also prevent rules that are added directly into the exception from firing (since as far as I can tell resolveList knows nothing about exceptions). This would be true regardless of the availability of the NoOp. (I believe that we have other places we would "toss" these as well, so this would not fix that particular issue completely.)

I can try to check out the activity and comment out the resolve list and see what shakes out, but I wanted to run it by you guys first to see if you remember a reason for it.

Subject: blocking a rule in an exception

Greg,

At yesterday's standup someone mentioned that blocking a rule from an exception no longer works. I didn't quite follow the chain, but it sounded like we actually removed the blocking rule manually, but rules resolution then finds and runs the rule that we wanted to block. This doesn't make sense to me. Do you have an idea about this problem, or should I follow up the team for more details?

THANKS!

2014-12-20 16:55:45.8270 Content is This is to clarify the requirement surrounding ECF eligibility of the addressees in the Switchplate (Obligated parties, filing parties, clerk, trustee, filing parties attorney, Pro-se Attorney). It is presently unclear in the story that not all of the recipients need to have the ECF eligibility requirement (toggle of the Electronically Filed and the Physical Address on the POC.)  The only parties that need to receive the ECF requirement are the Trustee and the Filing Party Attorney. If the ECF eligibility check Yes/No Indicator is check yes then the /s/ signature is used and the Trustee and Filing Party Attorney will have the Served Electronically without the physical address.  The inverse is true if no is selected. 

The clerk of court will not have the ECF logic for the text to appear or not beneath the addresses. Also, the pro-se attorney, filing parties, and obligated parties will not have the option for served electronically to appear. 

The decision was made to have a single check yes/no ECF indicator for all ECF eligible recipients (Trustee, Filing Party Attorney).

2014-12-20 16:55:48.7690 Content is During the meeting Tuesday, October 18, 2011, we discussed the options currently available for reporting security.  
1)  restrictions have the restrictions based upon access group, unit and workgroup or
2)  Assigning the report with a skill.
During that conversation, I inquired if there is an option available to combine both of the items.  At this time, there is no combination of access group, unit/workgroup and skill for the reports so it is not an option.

Therefore, since the options above will allow numerous user to have access to the reports which could add risk associated with latency, I've requested that the requirements for the original story of restricting the access for the reports to three users:  2 in EO Linda Zylstra, Benjamin Battock and 1 in Little Rock Benjamin Allen to be changed to update the requirements to allow only access to mimic my production profile settings which are:  ExecutiveOffice Unit / workgroup  Access Group:  GMAC-BusinessAnalyst  Portal Layout:  CAManagerPortal  Work Pool GMAC-SAM-Work

2014-12-20 16:55:49.1800 Content is I have a business clarification.

 

Suppose there are 2 filing parties who reaffirmed initially  and we entered the Rescission date and set the indicator true. And suppose the customer calls back next day and says that he doesnt want to rescind. In this case if we go to the attempt rescission and modify the indicator Rescinded to NO it is asking to enter the Rescission Date as a mandatory field though he didnt rescinded which I feel is a bug

 

 

The question is can the customer change their decision on Rescission anytime and if so what is the process and how we are going to handle it

Agents would need to re-enter the Reaffirmation / Accept Deny flowlet and change the signature field from yes to no. One discharged, the case will show reaffirmed. The rescission information will still be there but that may be needed.

This is potential where CARS can have up to 4 different addresses, so we cannot base the requirement on address being the same to show the lessee/colessee.  We can have the Garaging Address reflected in all obligated parties so if the account searched has a buyer/lessee and cobuyer/colessee the check box for the fulfillment combination is checked by default.  In those instances where there is a Guarantor, we will have to train the users to suppress the fulfillment for the Guarantor. 

Also, the default phone number is CSC - so with the reference to General is CSC.

Trustee Dismissal Request Letter:  Im thinking we should have this available on all Ch 13s regardless of plans or confirmation (what if they are not paying us adequate protection payments and it is 8 months into the case and it hasnt confirmed??)

 

Payment Cure Confirmation Letter:  Im pretty sure this is only available after confirmation (that is what Lori said), so we can just look for a live confirmed plan or the status of Post Confirmation  Active to generate this letter.

 

Also, Brandi and Lori both said that these letters SHOULD not be sent if there is open Lit pending (but should we lock it down that much in SAM?)  Maybe a warning pop up instead?

When Joe clicks on the Domain in either the Rules or Exceptions tab the system will build the entire tree. This can take many seconds depending on the size of the domain. The benefit of the current solution is that once it is complete the entire tree is instantly available to Joe. The drawback is that it takes a long time (longer for each node added to the tree) and a lot of system/db resources.

Since Joe will probably only be working on a small number of nodes at a time we should reconfigure the tree GUI to use AJAX (same technology as the refresh button)to only build the node details when the user clicks on it. We can decide to do this either for each child node or only at the "root node" level (i.e. once Joe clicks the root node all of its children are built).

Discovered that Joe really can not be allowed to change the category of a rule after the first rule set version containing the initial rule is locked and promoted to production. If we allowed Joe to change the category we'd always run into the problem where runRulesByCategory would blindly pickup and execute the rule twice; once with the old category and a second time with the new category. Given this situation we've decided that Joe can not change a rule's category. Need to disable the editing of custom rules so that Joe can not change a rule's category.
There is a situation where Joe could change a rule's category. That's when the rule is initially created and is only in an open ruleset version. In this case, it would be Ok for Joe to change the rule's category. If needed, these capability will be written up in a future story.

This story reads:As Joe the business rules manager, I need a way to see that a rule is nested and not invoked as a top-level rule. This is of value to me because I will break complicated business logic into chains of rules and will have to know which rules are top-level rules verse called rules.
We do not have any way today to look at a rule and tell if itis "called". The way the platforms are handling this today is by placing these called rules into a catagory that is never called by the flow. Joe has no way of knowing from just looking at the system (unless it's hinted at in the name of the category) that these rules will only run if/when referenced in another category.The only way I can think of being able to do this would be flagging each rule that is "called" with a custom field called something like "CalledOnly" and a value of "True". At runtime we are alreadying opening up each rule to check for a pagecontext to see if we need to perform double iteration, so it would not be any more expensive to check for a new custom field. If true, we would skip the execution of this rule. Otherwise continue as normal.If we decide to do this, I would like some opinion on how/where the list should by updated. Do we really want another column to take up space on the explorers for a column that will likely be No 95% of the time? Should we overload "Ready To Execute" to be "Yes (Called)", "No (Called)" or "Blocked (Called)"?If we do decide to go down this path I believe we are talking aprox 2-3 units to make the changes and test/document.Greg

Perhaps worth created a case with Salesforce.  I'll look into that.

Use the QA1/Chnl1 layer
Process Work Tab
Select --> Override Rule in an Exception
Set Fire Exception to "No" and Submit
You should see 6 messages(2 of each type). Note that each type has 1 at the BlissQAChnl1 layer and 1 at the BlissPlatMain layer. Also note that the message emitted in each case starts with "Test Msg". This is the baseline without the exception in play.

To test the override into the exception
Select --> Override Rule in an Exception
Set Fire Exception to "Yes" and Submit
You should again see 6 messages (still 2 of each type). However, the text of the message shoud be [rule name] @ IRFireException layer. These are rules overriden into the exception. Also note that the message text contains "(exception version)" which is text from a IRFireException version of the TestMsg message.

*** Note that the test says that these situations will create a "No Op" rule. As of PRPC 5.1 this is no longer necessary. As long as a version of the rule exists somewhere in the hierarchy then you can make a "circumstanced" version. We will still need NoOps under the covers for New Rules In An Exception, but thats a different test.

Use the QA1/Chnl1 layer
Process Work Tab
Select -->New Rule in an Exception
Set Fire Exception to "No" and Submit
You should seeNO messages. This shows that no rules are firing without the exception in place.

To test the new rule in the exception
Select --> New Rule in an Exception
Set Fire Exception to "Yes" and Submit
You should again see3 messages.
The first message should be "Test Msg (exception version) - NewMapInException rule @ IRFireException layer - should only appear if exception in play". This tests that the rule will fire ONLY when the exception is in play...it adds a new rule to the category.

The second message should be "Test Msg (exception version) - NewMapInException3 rule @ IRFireException layer - testing new rule in multiple exceptions - this should display since it is rank 1". This was supposed to test the addition of a new rule with the same name into2 different exceptions. The system, however, does not allow the creation of the 2nd rule with the same name. I believe this is the "expected" functionality. If not, we should probably get a different story to enhance the system to allow it.

Note that we jump from NewMapInException to NewMapInException3. We have a NewMapInException2, however, it is set to Available = No. This tests that the rule can be turned off and we will not throw an error.

The final message is "EXCEPTION ONLY Message (msg added directly to the exception) - NewMapInException4 rule @ IRFireException layer - test emitting a message that only exists in an exception ". This tests that you can add a message directly into an exception and reference it in an exception only rule.

You should again see 1 message with the text "Test Msg (exception version) - ExceptionNotAvailableMap1 @ ExceptionNotAvail2 level - should appear when IRFireException is Yes ". The '@ ExceptionNotAvail2 level' is the key part here. We have a rule in ExceptionNotAvail1 and it is higher in the stack rank, but the exception is Draft/Not Available, so it falls through to the one in ExceptionNotAvail2.
